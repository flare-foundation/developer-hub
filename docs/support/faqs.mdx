This page answers common questions encountered by developers building applications on Flare networks.

## Network & Tokens

### Where can I get testnet tokens (faucet)?

Flare provides faucets for its public testnets:

- **Flare Testnet Coston2:** Get C2FLR from the [Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2). Use Coston2 for testing applications intended for Flare mainnet.
- **Songbird Testnet Coston:** Get CFLR from the [Coston Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston). Use Coston for testing applications intended for the Songbird canary network.

### How do I add Flare/Songbird networks to my wallet (e.g., MetaMask)?

The easiest way is to visit the respective block explorer, scroll down to the footer, and click the "Add Network" button:

- **Flare Mainnet:** [Flarescan](https://flarescan.com/) or [Flare Explorer](https://flare-explorer.flare.network/)
- **Coston2 Testnet:** [Coston2 Flarescan](https://coston2.testnet.flarescan.com/) or [Coston2 Explorer](https://coston2-explorer.flare.network/)
- **Songbird Canary-Network:** [Songbird Flarescan](https://songbird.flarescan.com/) or [Songbird Explorer](https://songbird-explorer.flare.network/)
- **Coston Testnet:** [Coston Flarescan](https://coston.testnet.flarescan.com/) or [Coston Explorer](https://coston-explorer.flare.network/)

Alternatively, you can add them manually using the details on the [Network Configuration](/network/overview#configuration) page.

### What's the difference between Flare and Songbird?

- **Flare (FLR):** The main production network with real economic value.
- **Songbird (SGB):** A "canary network" - blockchain used for testing protocol-level features and dApps in a live environment with real consequences before they are potentially deployed to Flare. It serves as a proving ground.

Read more on the [Network Overview](/network/overview) page.

### Which RPC endpoint should I use?

- **For Development/Testing:** The [Public RPCs](/network/overview#configuration) are convenient for getting started. However, they have rate limits and shared resources.
- **For Production Applications:** It is **strongly recommended** to use a dedicated RPC endpoint from a provider for better performance, reliability, and support. See the [Developer Tools](/network/developer-tools#rpcs) page for options.
- **For Running Nodes:** You can also run your own [RPC node](/run-node#rpc-node).

### What is the block time and finality on Flare?

Flare networks use the Snowman++ consensus protocol.

- **Block Time:** Approximately 1.8 seconds.
- **Finality:** Near-instantaneous (single-slot finality). Once a block is accepted by consensus, it's considered final.

Learn more on the [Consensus](/network/consensus) page.

## Development Resources

### Where can I find the addresses of Flare's core smart contracts?

The addresses for contracts like `WNat`, `FtsoV2`, `FdcHub`, etc., vary by network.

1.  **Use the `FlareContractRegistry`:** This contract acts as a directory. It has the **same address** (`0xaD67FE66660Fb8dFE9d6b1b4240d8650e30F6019`) on **all** Flare networks (Flare, Coston2, Songbird, Coston). You can query its [`getContractAddressByName`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getcontractaddressbyname) or [`getAllContracts`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getallcontracts) methods to find the addresses of other contracts on the specific network you are connected to.
2.  **Check the Solidity Reference:** Deployed contract addresses for each network are listed on the relevant reference pages for convenience:
    - [Network Reference](/network/solidity-reference)
    - [FSP Reference](/network/fsp/solidity-reference)
    - [FTSOv2 Reference](/ftso/solidity-reference)
    - [Scaling Reference](/ftso/scaling/solidity-reference)
    - [FDC Reference](/fdc/reference)
    - [FAssets Reference](/fassets/reference)

### Are there official developer tools or SDKs?

Flare maintains several resources to aid development:

- **Language-Specific Guides:** Tutorials for interacting with Flare using [JavaScript](/network/guides/flare-for-javascript-developers), [Python](/network/guides/flare-for-python-developers), [Go](/network/guides/flare-for-go-developers), and [Rust](/network/guides/flare-for-rust-developers).
- **Starter Kits:** Pre-configured project templates for [Hardhat & Foundry](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit).
- **Developer Tools List:** A curated list of [RPCs, Indexers, Bridges, SDKs, and more](/network/developer-tools).

### Where can I learn about Flare-specific terminology?

Learn more about the terminology used in the Flare ecosystem (like FTSO, FSP, PDA, etc.) on the [Terminology](/support/terminology) page.

## Community & Support

### I have a project I would like to build on Flare. Can I get a grant?

Yes! The Flare Foundation offers grants to support innovative projects that contribute to the ecosystem's growth.
Learn more and apply on the [Flare Grants Program](https://flare.network/grants/) page.

### Where can I get technical support or ask questions?

Connect with Flare's developer community and the team through these channels:

- **Flare Experts:** Get dedicated [Developer Support](https://flare.network/resources/developer-support) from a Flare expert.
- **Discord:** The primary channel for developer Q&A, discussions, and support. Join the [Flare Network Discord](https://discord.com/invite/flarenetwork) and head to the developer channels.
- **Telegram:** Engage with the broader community on [Telegram](https://t.me/FlareNetwork) (may be less developer-focused).
- **GitHub:** Report issues, contribute to code, or explore the open-source repositories at [Flare Foundation GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/). (Best for code-specific issues, not general Q&A).
