# Setting up a VM

Follow these steps to set up and configure your Google Cloud VM instance.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install the gcloud CLI**

   Follow the [gcloud CLI installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) steps for your OS.

   :::note[Common Installation Issues]
   If you encounter `gcloud: command not found` after installation:

   1. Source your profile:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # For Linux/WSL
   source ~/.zshrc   # For macOS
   ```

   2. If the issue persists, add gcloud to your PATH:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/google-cloud-sdk/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   3. Add the above line to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile) for permanent effect
      :::

   Verify installation:

   ```bash
   gcloud version
   ```

2. **Authenticate your CLI**

   :::warning[Important]
   Make sure to use the same Google account email that you submitted in the hackathon registration form. Using a different account will result in permission errors.
   :::

   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

   Verify project access:

   ```bash
   gcloud projects list  # Should show verifiable-ai-hackathon
   ```
