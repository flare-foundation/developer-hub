Flare Fronted provides a comprehensive overview of the front-end architecture and workflows used across the Flare ecosystem. This documentation serves as a central reference for developers working on Flare's user-facing interfaces and related applications.

Flare Fronted is built with **React** as the core UI library, structured using **Next.js** for routing and server-side rendering, and integrates **TanStack Query** to handle data fetching, caching, and synchronization efficiently. Together, these technologies provide a robust, scalable, and performant framework for building interfaces that interact seamlessly with the Flare blockchainâ€”the blockchain for data.

Within this section, you'll find guides covering core concepts, recommended practices, and implementation details to ensure consistency, reliability, and maintainability across Flare's front-end projects.
