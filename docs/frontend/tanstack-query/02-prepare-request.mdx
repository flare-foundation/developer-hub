In the following series of guides we will prepare different ABI encoded requests that can be submitted to the FDC.
The guides will showcase code for making a request of each [attestation type](/fdc/attestation-types/).
They will also include an interactive widget for testing the code.
While we could pack all of these into a single component with selectable tabs, we believe it would make for a less understandable code.
For that reason, each guide will cover only one attestation type.

Preparing the request is a core step of the [FDC process](/fdc/overview).
In order to be able to submit request data to the protocol, we need to encode it in a specific way.
While this process can be done manually, it is recommended that the data is encoded through a special verifier server.
Besides encoding the data, the server also checks its validity.
Thus, it is a useful tool for catching user error.

We will make the request to the verifier server with the [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) library.
Because we want the request to be sent only when the user presses a button, we will not employ its `useQuery` hook.
Instead, we will utilize [`useMutation`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/mutations).
