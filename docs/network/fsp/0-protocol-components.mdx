## Voters

Voters are off-chain participants in Flare's protocols, responsible for threshold-weighted voting across all sub-protocols. The system anticipates **100 voters**, selected among validators with the highest vote power.

**Vote Power Sources**:

- **P-chain Stake**: Adding FLR stake to a validator node.
- **WNat Delegations**: Community members delegate vote power via the WNat smart contract.

Each voter is identified by an **identity address** (managed securely via cold wallets), used for:

- Establishing voter identity.
- Conducting admin operations (e.g., setting fees, signing addresses, delegation addresses).
- Enabling delegations to a voter's address for WNat and staking weight.

**Signing and Prioritized Addresses**:

- Voters can set a **signing address** (hot wallet) for protocol participation.
- **Prioritized submission addresses** are used for on-chain communication, defaulting to the identity address.
- Rewards are distributed either directly to the identity address or based on participation weights (delegation and node IDs).

## Voting Periods

- **Voting Epoch**: The shortest voting unit, lasting **90 seconds**. The first epoch starts at `T0` and increments by `i * 90s`.
- **Reward Epoch**: Comprises **3360 voting epochs** (approx. 3.5 days). Identified by reward epoch IDs, with each reward epoch starting after the previous one concludes. However, reward epochs may be extended due to network delays.

**Voting Rounds**:

- Sub-protocols typically vote once per voting epoch.
- System protocols may vote once per reward epoch.
- Each voting round is identified by the ID of the epoch in which it started.

## Voting Results and Finalization

Each sub-protocol aims to reach consensus on a **Merkle root** for every voting round:

- Voters independently compute candidate Merkle roots and submit signed roots on-chain.
- A root is confirmed if it surpasses a **50%+ voting weight threshold**.
- Finalization occurs when signatures exceeding the threshold are submitted to the [`Relay`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRelay) contract, which verifies and stores confirmed Merkle roots. These are accessible for proof verification by other smart contracts.

**Protocol Message Structure**:

- (`pID`, `roundID`, `isSecureRandom`, `root`): Contains sub-protocol ID, voting round ID, random number status, and Merkle root.

**Random Number Inclusion**:

- Certain protocols (e.g., FTSO scaling) embed random numbers into Merkle trees, enabling secure random number generation for further use.

## Using Confirmed Voting Results

To verify data on-chain:

1. Smart contracts receive:
   - Protocol data (structured as a Solidity struct).
   - Voting round ID.
   - Merkle proof.
2. The smart contract encodes the data and applies the Merkle proof to match the confirmed root from the **Relay contract**.
3. If the roots match, the data is verified.

## Voting (Signing) Policies

Voter eligibility and weights are determined for each **reward epoch** (~3.5 days). The **Signing Policy Definition Protocol** sets the eligible voters, their weights, and the threshold required for confirmation before each reward epoch begins.

**Sources of Voting Weight**:

- **P-chain Stake ($W_P$)**: Long-term staked FLR.
- **Mirrored Stake ($W_M$)**: Roughly similar to $W_P$
- **C-chain Stake ($W_C$)**: Planned for future use.
- **WNat Delegations ($W_{WFLR}$)**: Community-delegated vote power on the WNat contract.

**Aggregated Voting Weight**:

$$
W(v, r) = A(W_{M}(v, r), W_{C}(v, r), W_{WFLR}(v, r))
$$

- **Capped WFLR**: Limited to 2.5% of total wrapped weight.
- **Total Voting Weight**: Calculated by summing up the weights of all eligible voters.

## Weight Participation and Fees

- **P-chain Stake**: Requires a node ID and declared staking fee. Delegators contribute to the weight by staking on node IDs.
- **WNat Delegations**: Voters set delegation fees on the [`EntityManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IEntityManager) contract. Community members delegate to addresses based on yields and fees.
- **C-chain Stake**: Participation logic is under development.

## Signing Policies and Thresholds

A **signing policy** includes:

- `rewardEpochId`: Reward epoch ID.
- `startVotingRoundId`: Indicates the start of a reward epoch.
- `voters`: Canonical list of voter addresses.
- `weights`: Compressed, normalized weights (2-byte values).
- `threshold`: Usually set to **50%+** of total weight.
- `seed`: Secure random seed.

**Threshold Adjustments**:

- Regular threshold: **50%+**
- In case of delays: **60%+**

## Signature Verification

Uses standard ECDSA signatures. The [`Relay`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRelay) contract checks if the signing policy is supported by comparing stored hashes with the provided calldata, minimizing on-chain storage costs.

## Random Number Generation

Random numbers are generated as a byproduct of [FTSOv2 Scaling](/ftso/scaling/overview) using a commit-reveal process.
