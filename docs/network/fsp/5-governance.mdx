Flare governance empowers the community by providing a structured process for decision-making across the Flare and Songbird networks.
This governance framework plays a crucial role in decentralization and allows participants to:

- Propose policy changes
- Vote on them
- Execute approved proposals

## Proposal Types and Networks

On Flare Mainnet and Songbird Canary-Network, there are three different types of proposals:

### Flare Improvement Proposals (FIPs)

- **Network**: Flare Mainnet
- **Initiator**: Flare Foundation
- **Default Status**: Rejected by default
- **Voting Tokens**: `WFLR` (wrapped `FLR`)
- **Approval Condition**: Simple majority vote in favor
- **Quorum Requirement**: None

FIPs are proposed enhancements designed to improve the stability of Flare Mainnet.
They follow an acceptance-based voting process, where approval requires a simple majority of cast votes to be in favor.

### Songbird Test Proposals (STPs)

- **Network**: Songbird Canary-Network
- **Initiator**: Flare Foundation
- **Default Status**: Accepted by default
- **Voting Tokens**: `WSGB` (wrapped `SGB`)
- **Rejection Conditions**:
  - **Threshold**: At least 75% of all circulating `SGB` tokens must participate
  - **Majority**: More than 50% of votes must be against the proposal
- **Outcome**: STPs are accepted unless both rejection conditions are met

STPs allow rapid testing of proposals on Songbird Canary-Network before their implementation on Flare Mainnet.
If either the quorum threshold is not met or fewer than half of the votes cast are against, the proposal is accepted.

### Songbird Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

- **Network**: Songbird Canary-Network
- **Initiator**: Flare Foundation
- **Default Status**: Rejected by default
- **Voting Tokens**: `WSGB` (wrapped `SGB`)
- **Approval Condition**: Simple majority vote in favor
- **Quorum Requirement**: None

SIPs are proposed enhancements designed to improve the stability of Songbird Canary-Network.
They follow an acceptance-based voting process, where approval requires a simple majority of cast votes to be in favor.

## Voting Process

### Eligibility and Vote Power

To participate in governance, users must hold wrapped tokens. Voting power is determined by the number of wrapped tokens a user possesses:

| Network                 | Proposal Type | Token | Wrapped Token |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Flare Mainnet           | FIP           | `FLR` | `WFLR`        |
| Songbird Canary-Network | STP           | `SGB` | `WSGB`        |
| Songbird Canary-Network | SIP           | `SGB` | `WSGB`        |

The Flare Foundation announces proposals in advance, allowing users to wrap their tokens before voting begins.

### Vote Transfer

Users can transfer their voting power to another address while retaining ownership of their wrapped tokens. This feature is useful for consolidating votes across multiple self-custody wallets.

- Votes can be transferred to a single address but received from multiple addresses.

- Transferred votes cannot be further delegated.

- Once activated, all votes from an account are transferred to the designated address until the delegation is canceled.

**Example**: If an account holds 100 `WSGB` and enables vote delegation, it transfers 100 votes. If an additional 100 `WSGB` is acquired later, the delegation automatically transfers 200 votes in the next proposal.

### Vote Count Block

Since token balances fluctuate, a snapshot of all accounts is taken before voting starts.
This snapshot, known as the **vote count block**, determines the number of votes an account can cast.

To encourage active participation and prevent strategic acquisition of tokens solely for voting, the vote count block is selected randomly.

### Voting Procedure

The governance voting process follows a structured sequence:

1. **Proposal Announcement:** The Flare Foundation publishes proposals on [Flare Governance Proposals](https://proposals.flare.network/), the Flare website and social media channels (see footer for links).

2. **Notice Period:** A minimum one reward epoch window allows for discussion, clarifications, and potential cancellation of flawed proposals.

3. **Block Selection Period:** The vote count block is selected randomly within this timeframe.

4. **Voting Period:** Voting occurs on the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) and usually lasts one week (around two reward epochs). Results are published at the conclusion.

The voting process follows these key principles:

- **Threshold condition:** Some proposals require a minimum quorum for validity.

- **Majority condition:** More than 50% of votes cast must support or oppose the proposal.

## Proposal Execution

Once a proposal is accepted, execution occurs based on its implementation method:

- **Smart Contract Execution:** Governance contracts enable automatic execution through contract calls.

- **Manual Execution:** Proposals requiring off-chain actions are executed by the Flare Foundation.

- **Future Automation:** Over time, additional automation mechanisms may be introduced.
