The **Flare Systems Protocol** encompasses the following core system protocols:

1. **Signing Policy Definition Protocol**
2. **Validator Uptime Voting Protocol**
3. **Reward Voting Protocol**
4. **Random Number Generation Protocol** (dependent on [FTSOv2 Scaling](/ftso/scaling/overview))

Protocols with voting frequencies tied to reward epochs are implemented directly on the [`FlareSystemsManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IFlareSystemsManager) smart contract, while others operate as sub-protocols. Each sub-protocol has a unique protocol ID, except for the system protocols mentioned above.

## Signing Policy Definition Protocol

The Signing Policy Definition Protocol is a system protocol which ensures that data providers and their weights for the next reward epoch are locked and signed by a threshold weight of current data providers.
The protocol works in phases, as follows:

- **Random Number Acquisition**: Around 2 hours before the end of the current reward epoch, a random number is fetched through the [FTSOv2 Scaling](/ftso/scaling/overview) protocol.
- **Vote Power Block Selection**: Once a random number is obtained a block from the current reward epoch is selected at random.
  The vote power registered in this selected block will be used for the new reward epoch.
- **Voter Registration**: Once a random number is obtained, registration for the new reward epoch can begin.
  This lasts 30 minutes, allowing self-registration based on the selected block’s vote power.
- **Signing Policy Snapshot**: When the voter registration phase ends, a snapshot of the data providers' addresses and weights is taken.
- **Signing Policy Sign Phase**: After the voter registration phase, the signing phase begins.
  In this phase the data providers registered for the ongoing epoch submit signatures for updating the signing policy.
  This phase ends when the threshold of signatures is reached.
  Delays beyond 20 minutes or 600 blocks will incur penalties.

While there are no direct rewards, delays in finalization cause a global lock of reward claiming and additional penalization when claiming is finally allowed.
More specifically, each signer gets punished with burn of their fee claims, scaled quadratically with the length of the delay.

## Validator Uptime Voting Protocol

Following each reward epoch, data providers submit signed lists of validator NodeIDs that, in their view, achieved sufficient uptime (≥80%) during the preceding epoch.
The voting process concludes upon reaching a defined threshold weight.

Since the up-time data is needed for calculation of the rewards, the lack of a successful finalization blocks the execution of the reward voting protocol.

## Reward Voting Protocol

After each reward epoch, and once uptime voting is complete, data providers calculate cumulative reward claims for all sub protocols.
The calculation of rewards takes into account all inputs and on-chain records of participation of data providers in a specific sub protocol.

Reward claims across all sub-protocols are aggregated into a Merkle tree.
Voting takes place for the corresponding Merkle root, and, once confirmed, the `RewardManager` contract can verify individual claims and execute reward payouts.
We refer to [Rewarding](/network/fsp/rewarding) for more details on how rewards are calculated and claimed.

## Random Number Generation Protocol

Random numbers are generated as a byproduct of the [FTSOv2 Scaling](/ftso/scaling/overview) protocol, which employs a Commit & Reveal scheme.
In this scheme, each commitment includes not only feed values but also a locally generated random number.
This random number serves to blind the user's commit hash, protecting it against search-based attacks.

Once the reveal phase begins, the random numbers from valid reveals are aggregated into a single random value for the current voting epoch.
This aggregated random number is included in the Merkle root for the epoch, confirmed via the [`Relay`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRelay) contract.
