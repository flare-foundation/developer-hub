The **Flare Systems Protocol** utilizes a set of offchain services encapsulated within the **Flare Systems Client**.
These services interact with blockchain smart contracts to support various protocols.
Key components include:

1. **Protocol Manager Service**: Handles periodic transactions for each voting round.
   The content of these transactions depends on the participation across the sub-protocols.
2. **Reward Aggregator Service**: Submits the Merkle root of combined reward claims once per reward epoch.
3. **Signing Policy Voter Service**: Signs new signing policies after they are defined, once per reward epoch.
4. **Voter Registration Service**: Executes data provider registration on the [`VoterRegistry`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IVoterRegistry) contract.
5. **Finalizer Service**: Submits finalization transactions when a data provider is eligible to finalize a specific sub-protocol.
6. **Scheduler**: Coordinates transaction scheduling across all other services.
7. **Uptime Voting Client**: Submits validator uptime votes once per reward epoch.

Each data provider runs an independent instance of the [Flare Systems Client](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-system-client), which manages private keys and transaction submissions, enabling participation across multiple sub-protocols.

## Protocol Manager Service

The **Protocol Manager Service** sends the following transactions within each voting epoch:

- `submit1`, `submit2`, `submit3`: Data submission at fix scheduled times during the voting epoch.
- `submitSignatures`: Submits signatures only once all required data is collected.

**Data Flow**:

1. The service queries protocol specific data sources via API routes to fetch data.
2. The collected data is processed, encoded into byte sequences, and sent in transaction calldata as:
   ```
   tx_data = function_selector + concatenated_data
   ```
   where each payload includes:
   - `protocolId`: the protocol id.
   - `votingRoundId`: the id of the voting round.
   - `size`: the number of bytes in the payload.
   - `payload`: protocol specific data encoded protocol data encoded into bytes.

**API Endpoints and Response Format**:

- `GET /submit1/:votingRoundId/:submitAddress`
- `GET /submit2/:votingRoundId/:submitAddress`
- `GET /submitSignatures/:votingRoundId/:submitSignaturesAddress`
- `GET /submit3/:votingRoundId/:submitAddress`
- Response Format:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "OK",
    "data": "0x1234...",
    "additionalData": "0x5678..."
  }
  ```

The services are data provider-agnostic, requiring only `votingRoundId` and `submitAddress` as inputs.

## Reward Aggregator Service

The **Reward Aggregator Service** calculates and submits the Merkle root of reward claims at the end of each reward epoch:

- Fetches reward data from protocol reward calculators using C-chain and P-chain indexers.
- Submits the final Merkle root via `signRewards`.

**API Endpoints and Response Format**:

- `GET /rewards/:rewardEpochId`
- Response Format:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "OK",
    "data": "0xabc123..."
  }
  ```

## Signing Policy Voter Service

The **Signing Policy Voter Service** monitors the `SigningPolicyInitialized` event on the [`Relay`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRelay) contract.
This event occurs when a new signing policy is defined.
The service has the following roles:

- Detect new signing policy creation event.
- Signs the new policy using the `signNewSigningPolicy` function.
- Tracks `SigningPolicySigned` events on the [`FlareSystemsManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IFlareSystemsManager) contract in order to determine if further signatures are needed, and to confirm their vote.

## Voter Registration Service

The **Voter Registration Service** listens to events on the [`FlareSystemsManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IFlareSystemsManager) contract in order to register a data provider for the next epoch.
The service works as follows:

- Listens for `VotePowerBlockSelected` events on the [`FlareSystemsManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IFlareSystemsManager) contract.
- Registers the data provider via the `registerVoter` method on the [`VoterRegistry`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IVoterRegistry) contract before the `SigningPolicyInitialized` event signals the end of the registration period.

## Finalizer Service

The **Finalizer Service** monitors `submitSignatures` function calls on indexer and carries out finalization for every voting round.
The service works as follows:

- Collect signatures from various `submitSignatures` transactions.
- Once a sufficient weight of signatures is gathered for a specific voting round, the service is ready to submit finalization data to the [`Relay`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRelay) contract.
- The finalizer service then decides whether to send the finalization data, by checking the data provider's eligibility for rewards.
  Namely, during the **grace period**, submissions from randomly selected data providers are reward eligible, as discussed in more detail in [Rewarding](/network/fsp/rewarding).
- If eligible, then the service submit the data to the [`Relay`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRelay) contract via the `relay` function.

Importantly, finalizations sent within the grace period must be sent through the signing address (i.e. the address registered on the signing policy).

## Data Submissions

### Data Encoding and Payloads

Data for `submitSignatures` is structured as follows:

- `type` (1 byte): Message type (0 or 1).
- `message` (38 bytes):
  - `protocolId` (1 byte)
  - `votingRoundId` (4 bytes)
  - `randomQualityScore` (1 byte)
  - `merkleRoot` (32 bytes)
- `signature` (65 bytes): ECDSA signature components of the message (`v`, `r`, `s`).
- `unsignedMessage` (optional): Additional data (e.g., revealed random number).

### Data Availability and Merkle Trees

Each sub-protocol assembles a certain Merkle trees using offchain data:

- The data used for the Merkle tree is obtained via the `GET /data/:votingRoundID` endpoint.
  The response format should be of the form:
  ```json
  {
      "status": "OK",
      "data": [{"abiName": "StructName", "data": {...}}]
  }
  ```
- ABI definitions are accessible via `GET /data-abis`, with an expected response format:
  ```json
  {
      "status": "OK",
      "data": JSONAbiDefinition[]
  }
  ```

### Storage and Calculation Model

The data used in calculation for Merkle trees is all timestamped and includes the following types:

- Events emitted by smart contracts.
- Calldata from specific contract calls.
- Immutable contract values, indexed by time.

The **Flare blockchain indexer** enables querying by time intervals and event types.
Data providers use the indexer to fetch data and perform calculations, which are then encoded into Merkle roots.

The benefits of the proposed storage and calculation model include:

- Support for complex calculations beyond Solidity’s capabilities.
- Reduced storage costs by storing only Merkle roots on-chain.

### Result Availability and APIs

Data providers assemble Merkle roots for voting and can provide services to access confirmed data.
This data can be exposed via APIs, allowing users to obtain calculation results with full Merkle proofs for on-chain verification.

### Transaction Prioritization

The `Submission` smart contract prioritizes key transactions (`submit1`, `submit2`, `signatureDeposit`) to subsidize gas costs.
Multiple sign transactions are allowed, but only one subsidized submission is permitted per voting round.
