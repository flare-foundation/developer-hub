This guide explains how data providers can set up support for the [Web2 FDC attestation type](/fdc/attestation-types/web2-json).
The setup involves configuring a Web2 verifier server and updating the FDC Client.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [FDC Suite Deployment repository](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fdc-suite-deployment).
- Access to the [FSP Deployment repository](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-systems-deployment).
- API key for the Ignite Web2Json source (see [Obtaining an Ignite API Key](#obtaining-an-ignite-api-key))

## Set Up Web2 Verifier

1. Pull the [FDC Suite Deployment](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fdc-suite-deployment) repository version v1.2.0:

   ```bash
   git clone --branch v1.2.0 https://github.com/flare-foundation/fdc-suite-deployment.git
   cd fdc-suite-deployment
   ```

2. Configure environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example` for reference):

   ```bash
   WEB2_IGNITE_API_KEY=your_ignite_api_key_here
   WEB2_SOURCE_IDS=Ignite
   VERIFIER_API_KEYS=key1,key2
   ```

3. Run the configuration generator:

   ```bash
   ./generate-config.sh
   ```

4. Start the Web2 verifier server:

   ```bash
   cd web2-verifier/
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. (Optional) Specify memory and CPU restrictions in `docker-compose.yaml` if needed.

## Update FDC Client

1. Update your [Flare Systems Protocol Deployment](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-systems-deployment) to version v1.2.0:

   ```bash
   cd flare-systems-deployment
   git fetch origin
   git checkout v1.2.0
   ```

2. Set the verifier address and API key in `.env` (see `.env.example` for reference):

   ```bash
   IGNITE_WEB2JSON_URL=http://<host>:9801/verifier/web2/Web2Json/verifyFDC
   IGNITE_WEB2JSON_API_KEY=key1
   ```

   Replace `<host>` with the hostname or IP address where your Web2 verifier is running.

3. Regenerate the FDC Client configuration:

   ```bash
   ./populate-config.sh
   ```

4. Restart the FDC Client to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This pulls the latest version and recreates the container.

## Obtaining an Ignite API Key

API keys for the Ignite proxy are encrypted with each provider's signing policy public key.
For detailed instructions on how to obtain and decrypt your API key, see the [FDC Attestation Verifier repository](https://github.com/flare-foundation/verifier-indexer-api/tree/main/scripts/web2#readme).
