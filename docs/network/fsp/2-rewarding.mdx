Flare's sub-protocols utilize a uniform signing weight for decision-making; however, reward distribution is based on the delegators' participation weights. Each sub-protocol calculates rewards for various participation weight types, allowing delegators to claim rewards according to their specific contribution shares.

All rewards are managed through the [`RewardManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRewardManager) contract and are claimable after the reward epoch concludes.
Sub-protocols implement their own contracts to gather rewarding inputs, which are passed to the Reward Manager for distribution. Funding is provided by sub-protocol-specific contracts, which may also handle inflation-based rewards through automated offers.

## Minimal Conditions

The [FIP.10](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_10.html) and [SIP.04](http://proposals.flare.network/SIP/SIP_4.html) governance proposals introduced an incentive structure for participating in all protocols.
The proposals implemented a set of minimum participation requirements from the data providers in a reward epoch for all Flare protocols.
These proposals ensure that participation in Flare's **enshrined protocols** is not merely symbolic, but actively upheld by the network's validators through meaningful engagement.
Failure to meet **all** these requirements can ultimately lead to loss of rewards across all protocols.

### Passes

The incentive structure introduces the concept of **passes**.
Each provider has a number of passes, and can gain or lose passes depending on whether they meet the minimum participation requirements for each protocol.

- Newly registered data providers start with zero passes.
- When a data provider meets the minimum requirements in a reward epoch, they gain a pass.
  Providers can hold a maximum of 3 passes.
- When a data provider fails to meet the minimum requirements in a reward epoch, they lose a pass.
  Providers can lose one pass per protocol per reward epoch.
- If a provider would lose a pass but doesn't have any, they lose all rewards for the epoch.
  That is, a provider with 1 pass who fails to meet 1 minimal requirement will have 0 passes but will still achieve rewards, and a provider with 0 passes who fails to achieve a minimal requirement loses all rewards.

### Minimum participation requirements

Each Flare protocol implements the minimum participation requirements, defined across each reward epoch independently.
FTSO and Staking requirements were introduced in [FIP.10](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_10.html), while FDC requirements were defined in [FIP.12](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_12.html).
For completeness, these are also listed below:

- **Staking**: Providers must meet 80% total uptime in the reward epoch with at least 1M FLR in active self-bond.
  However, in order to earn passes, the provider must have at least 3M FLR in active self-bond and 15M in active stake.
  Providers with 80% total uptime and at least 1M FLR in active self-bond but not meeting both the 3M FLR active self-bond and 15M active stake requirements neither earn nor lose passes, and still receive eligible rewards.

- **FTSO anchor feeds**: Providers must submit a value estimate that lies within a 0.5% band around the consensus median value in 80% of voting rounds within a reward epoch.

- **FTSO block-latency feeds**: Providers must submit at least 80% of their expected number of updates within a reward epoch, unless they have very low weight, defined as < 0.2% of the total active weight.

- **FDC**: Data providers must successfully participate in 60% of all voting rounds within a reward epoch.
  That is, they must submit the correct Merkle root for that voting epoch.

## Reward Claim structure

All rewards are distributed through **reward claims**, which are data records indicating the allocation of rewards.
Each reward claim consists of the following fields:

- `rewardEpochId`: Identifier for the reward epoch.
- `beneficiary`: The address of the reward beneficiary or node ID (20-bytes).
- `amount`: Reward amount in `FLR`.
- `claimType`: The category of the reward claim, which can be one of the following:
  - `direct`: Rewards directly attributed to the beneficiary (address).
    These claims are used for undistributed rewards, fund providers, burn claims, or specific rewarding approaches within sub-protocols.
  - `fee`: Similar to `direct` claims, these are also rewards directly attributed to the beneficiary address, which, in this case, can only be an eligible data provider for the given reward epoch.
    The fees cover `WFLR` delegation fees and node staking fees.
  - `wflr`: Rewards that should be distributed to community delegators according to their share of `WFLR` (i.e., their contribution to the $W_{WFLR}$ weight).
    The beneficiary is an eligible data provider for the given reward epoch.
  - `mirror`: Rewards that should be distributed to stake delegators according to their contribution to the stake-mirrored $W_{M}$ weight.
    The beneficiary is an eligible data provider for the given reward epoch.

Weight-based claims (`wflr` and `mirror`) represent total rewards for data providers, to be distributed according to the delegators' participation in the data providers' weight.
We refer to the [Weights and Signing](/network/fsp/weights-and-signing) page for more details on how these weights are calculated.

### Calculation process

Each sub-protocol is responsible for calculating its **partial reward claims** for each reward epoch by:

1. **Data Input**: Determining the relevant data sources (indexers).
2. **Data Retrieval**: Querying data from indexers.
3. **Reward Calculation**: Implementing reward algorithms to produce partial reward claims.

Partial reward claims may have a negative amount if penalization is applied.
This allows misbehavior in one sub-protocol to reduce rewards earned in others, enforcing accountability across the entire system.
The [Reward Voting Protocol](/network/fsp/system-protocols) aggregates these partial claims into a single claim per beneficiary and type.
The final claims are structured into a Merkle tree, and the Merkle root is confirmed through a voting process.

### Claiming process

Once the Merkle root is confirmed for a reward epoch, rewards can be claimed via the [`RewardManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRewardManager) contract:

- For `direct` or `fee` claims, rewards are transferred directly to the beneficiary once the submitted proof is verified.
- For **weight-based claims**, the process involves two steps:
  1. **Initialization**: Submission of a reward claim with a Merkle proof to initialize contract variables.
  2. **Delegator Claims**: Delegators can then claim their share without needing additional proofs.

Once initialized, delegators can claim rewards through the [`RewardManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRewardManager) contract.
For a given reward epoch, the reward allocated to delegator $x$ associated to a specific data provider (beneficiary address) is calculated as:

$$
\text{reward} = \frac{w(T, x)}{U_{T}^{weight}}\times U_{T}^{amount}~,
$$

where:

<ul>
  <li>$ w(T, x) $ is the weight delegated by delegator $x$ to the beneficiary address for weight type $T$ (i.e. either delegated stake or delegated `WFLR`) during the specified reward epoch.</li>

{/* prettier-ignore */}

{" "}
<li>
  $ U_{T}^{weight} $ is the total yet unclaimed delegation weight associated
  with the beneficiary address and weight type $T$, for that epoch.
</li>

{/* prettier-ignore */}

  <li>$ U_{T}^{amount} $ is the total yet unclaimed reward amount for the same beneficiary and epoch.</li>
</ul>

Once claimed, both the unclaimed amount and weight are reduced accordingly, and the payout is transferred directly to delegator $x$.

## Incentivizing fast signing and finalization

Sub-protocols are designed to encourage fast signature deposition and finalization:

1. **Signing Deposition Rewards**:

   - Data providers submitting signatures within a grace period (10s) from the signature start time will automatically receive rewards.
   - Signatures submitted until the block of finalization are also rewarded.
   - If finalization happens after a **hard limit**, the end of the voting round during which the signing round started, then only those signatures submitted before the hard limit are considered for rewards, and only if they exceed a 30% weight threshold.

2. **Finalization Rewards**:
   - Finalization of a Merkle root can be carried out only once, by the first entity to collect sufficient signing weight of signatures and send them to the voting contract.
   - During a 20s grace period, a set of selected data providers gets rewarded either for successful finalization or an attempt of it. (i.e. If the call got reverted due to data being already finalized.)
   - If finalization is not carried out within the grace period, any other data provider is allowed to finalize, and the first entity to do so receives the full finalization reward.
   - Just like with signature deposition, finalization rewards are only available within a **hard cutoff**: finalization must occur before the end of the voting epoch following the one in which the signature round started.

The diagram below depicts how the signing and finalization grace periods and hard limits are applied for vote epoch $k$.

    }}

</div>

### Selection of Data Providers for finalization

During the grace period for finalization, selected data providers are rewarded based on a pseudo-random selection algorithm:

- A pseudo-random number is generated by hashing the protocol id and the voting round number.
- Data providers are selected with probability proportional to their signing weight in the active policy, using the previously generated pseudo-random number.
- Data providers are drawn sequentially until the total selected weight reaches a minimum threshold (set to 5% of total signing weight).
- The selected providers are rewarded proportionally to their individual weights relative to the total selected weight.

### Reward distribution

Each sub-protocol allocates rewards for **signing deposition** and **finalization**.
The reward amount attributed to a data provider is split into:

- **Fee Claims**: Deducted as delegation fees (WNat delegations).
- **Weight Participation Claims**: Remaining rewards are distributed among delegators and stakers based on their weights.
