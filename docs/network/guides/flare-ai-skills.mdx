[Flare AI Skills](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-ai-skills) is a collection of Agent Skills for Cursor, Claude Code, Codex and other [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) compatible agents.
The skills give your AI assistant structured domain knowledge about Flare.
That includes [Flare Time Series Oracle](/ftso/overview), [FAssets](/fassets/overview), [Flare Data Connector](/fdc/overview), and [Smart Accounts](/smart-accounts/overview).
You get accurate, context-aware help when building on Flare.

## Available skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **flare-general** | Flare overview, networks, chain IDs, RPC endpoints, explorers, faucets, and developer tooling |
| **flare-ftso** | [FTSO](/ftso/overview) price feeds, feed IDs, on-chain/off-chain consumption, fee calculation, delegation, and scaling anchor feeds |
| **flare-fassets** | [FAssets](/fassets/overview) overview, minting, redemption, agents, collateral, and smart contract integration |
| **flare-fdc** | [Flare Data Connector](/fdc/overview) overview, attestation types, request flow, Merkle proofs and Data Availability Layer (DAL) verification |
| **flare-smart-accounts** | [Smart Accounts](/smart-accounts/overview) overview, account abstraction for XRPL users to interact with Flare without owning FLR |

You can install one or more skills depending on what you are building on Flare.

## Installation

You can install the skills using the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) CLI, which is recommended for general use or in Claude Code.

### Using skills.sh

This is the recommended way to install the skills using the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) CLI.
Many AI agents support `skills.sh`, including Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and more.

From your project or any directory, run the following command to install the skills:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-ai-skills
```

It will ask you to select the skills you want to install.

Read more about `skills.sh` in the [skills.sh documentation](https://skills.sh/docs).

### Claude Code

To install the skills in Claude Code, add the marketplace and install the skills you need.

1. Add the marketplace:
   
  ```bash
  /plugin marketplace add flare-foundation/flare-ai-skills
  ```

2. Select skills you need and install them.

  ```bash
  /plugin install flare-general@flare-ai-skills
  /plugin install flare-ftso@flare-ai-skills
  /plugin install flare-fassets@flare-ai-skills
  /plugin install flare-fdc@flare-ai-skills
  /plugin install flare-smart-accounts@flare-ai-skills
  ```

3. Run this command to manage plugins in Claude Code:

  ```bash
  /plugin
  ```

Read more about [plugins in Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).


## Updating skills

To update all installed skills (when using `skills.sh`):

```bash
npx skills update
```

To update a single skill, reinstall it:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-ai-skills --skill flare-ftso
```

## Using the skills

After installation, use your AI agent as usual and refer to the skill when needed.

Example prompts (click the copy button to copy the full prompt):

- `Use the flare-general skill and explain how to set up a Hardhat project for Flare development` <CopyButton textToCopy="Use the flare-general skill and explain how to set up a Hardhat project for Flare development" />
- `Use the flare-ftso skill and show how to consume FTSO price feeds in a Solidity contract.` <CopyButton textToCopy="Use the flare-ftso skill and show how to consume FTSO price feeds in a Solidity contract" />
- `Use the flare-fassets skill and explain how to mint FXRP step by step` <CopyButton textToCopy="Use the flare-fassets skill and explain how to mint FXRP step by step" />
- `Use the flare-fdc skill and show how to request an EVMTransaction attestation and verify it in a contract` <CopyButton textToCopy="Use the flare-fdc skill and show how to request an EVMTransaction attestation and verify it in a contract" />
- `Use the flare-smart-accounts skill and show how to deposit to a vault` <CopyButton textToCopy="Use the flare-smart-accounts skill and show how to deposit to a vault" />

The agent will use the workflow and concepts from the Flare AI Skills `SKILL.md`.
It can reference Flare Developer Hub links from the reference files.
