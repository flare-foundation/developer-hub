Staking works by locking funds for a period of time to support a specific network validator. The guide details out how to stake using the [flare-stake-tool](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-stake-tool) CLI.

<details>
<summary>Understand staking on Flare.</summary>

When validator owners stake to their own nodes they **self-bond**, whereas all other participants are said to **delegate** their stake to that validator.
Note that delegating your stake to a validator is different from FTSO delegation.

Participants choose how much to stake and for how long their stake will be locked.
The minimum values are:

|                  | Self-bond | Delegation |
| ---------------- | --------: | ---------: |
| Minimum amount   |    1M FLR |    50K FLR |
| Minimum duration |   60 days |    14 days |

At the end of every reward epoch (i.e. 3.5 days on Flare Mainnet), participants are rewarded according to how well their chosen validator performed in that period.

**Limits**

The amount that you can stake and the rewards you can gain by staking are restricted by these limits:

- **Delegation factor**: Limits the total amount that can be staked to a validator to its self-bond, which is the amount validators stake to their own nodes, times the delegation factor, which is 15.
  For example, if a validator has a self-bond stake of 1M FLR, the total sum of all stakes, including delegations, cannot exceed 15M FLR.
  This limit allows for 14M FLR of delegations.

- **Staking cap**: Limits the reward performance of individual validators to **5% of the total staked amount**.
  If you stake your funds on a validator with more than 5% of the total staked amount, you receive less FLR in reward.
  To maximize your reward, delegate your staking funds to a validator with less than 5% of the total staked amount of FLR.

- **Maximum number of validators**: You can stake to any number of validators, but rewards, FlareDrops, and governance vote power only apply for up to 3 different validators.

Given that the Flare network uses two independent underlying chains, there is one extra step that must be considered.
Funds must be transferred from the C-chain, where smart contracts run, to the P-chain, where staking happens.
After the staking period expires and funds are unlocked, they can be transferred back to the C-chain.

## Prerequisites

Install the following tools:

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Setup

1. Install the `flare-stake-tool` CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install @flarenetwork/flare-stake-tool -g
   ```

2. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool
   ```

   The tool's banner is displayed:

   ```text
   _____ _                  ____  _        _           ____ _     ___
   |  ___| | __ _ _ __ ___  / ___|| |_ __ _| | _____   / ___| |   |_ _|
   | |_  | |/ _` | '__/ _ \ \___ \| __/ _` | |/ / _ \ | |   | |    | |
   |  _| | | (_| | | |  __/  ___) | || (_| |   <  __/ | |___| |___ | |
   |_|   |_|\__,_|_|  \___| |____/ \__\__,_|_|\_\___|  \____|_____|___|

   Version: 4.1.2
   ```

3. You can specify the account from which staking will take place in different ways - [using Ledger](#using-ledger-recommended) or [using a private key](#using-private-key).
   The only recommended way is to use a Ledger device.

### Using Ledger (recommended)

1. Connect your Ledger device to your computer and unlock it.
   Launch the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) application and navigate to the **My Ledger** tab and ensure your device firmware is up-to-date.

2. In the **App Catalog** tab, search for **Avalanche**, Click **Install**.

   :::info[App Size]

   The Avalanche app requires 138 KB of space on a **Ledger Nano S**.
   You may need to remove other apps if space is insufficient.

   :::

3. Exit Ledger Live and ensure the device is not connected to any other applications like MetaMask.
   Open the Avalanche app on your Ledger device. The screen should display **Avalanche Ready**.

4. Open a terminal and run the following command to start the staking tool in interactive mode:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

5. After the welcome banner, the tool prompts you to connect your wallet:

   ```text
   ? How do you want to connect your wallet? (Use arrow keys)
   > Ledger
   Public Key
   Private Key (not recommended)
   ```

   Select **Ledger** using the arrow keys and press **Enter**.

6. The next prompt asks you to choose the network:

   ```text
   ? Which network do you want to connect to? (Use arrow keys)
   > Flare (Mainnet)
   Coston2 (Testnet)
   LocalHost (for development only)
   ```

   Select **Flare (Mainnet)** and press **Enter**. A "Fetching Addresses..." message appears briefly. Select **Ledger Live** on the address derivation screen.

7. The tool will then display a list of addresses linked to your Ledger device, select the desired address and press **Enter**.
   Ensure this address has a sufficient `FLR` balance for transaction fees and staking. Funds can be transferred later if needed.

   The main menu will now appear:

   ```text
   ? What do you want to do? (Use arrow keys)
       View chain addresses
   >   Check on-chain balance
       Get network info
       Get validator info
       Move assets from C-chain to P-chain
       Move assets from P-chain to C-chain
       Add a validator node
   ```

   As an example, select **Check on-chain balance** and press **Enter**. The tool displays the C-chain and P-chain balances before exiting.

:::tip[Account Persistence]

After completing the setup, a `ctx.json` file is created in the current folder.
This file stores the selected account details, allowing you to skip the setup process on subsequent uses from the same folder.

:::

### Using private key

:::danger[Using a private key file]

Using a private key stored in a plain text file is **insecure** and should be avoided whenever possible.
It is highly recommended to [use Ledger](#using-ledger-recommended) instead.

:::

1. Create a text file (e.g. `/home/wallet/pvtKeyFile`) in a **secure folder** accessible only to you.

2. Open the file and insert one of the following lines based on your private key format:

   ```plaintext
   PRIVATE_KEY_CB58="" // Use this if your key is in CB58 format, keep the quotes.
   PRIVATE_KEY_HEX="" // Use this if your key contains 64 hexadecimal characters, keep the quotes.
   ```

3. Open a terminal and run the following command to start the staking tool in interactive mode:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

4. After the welcome banner, the tool prompts you to connect your wallet:

   ```plaintext
   ? How do you want to connect your wallet? (Use arrow keys)
       Ledger
       Public Key
   >   Private Key (not recommended)
   ```

   Select **Private Key** using the arrow keys and press **Enter**.

5. You'll see a security warning, enter the full file path where your private key file is stored and press **Enter**.

   ```text
   Warning: You are connecting using your private key which is not recommended
   ? Enter Path to Private Key file (E.g. /home/wallet/pvtKeyFile):
   ```

6. The next prompt asks you to choose the network:

   ```plaintext
   ? Which network do you want to connect to? (Use arrow keys)
   > Flare (Mainnet)
   Coston2 (Testnet)
   LocalHost (for development only)
   ```

   Select **Flare (Mainnet)** and press **Enter**.

7. The main menu will now appear:
   ```text
   ? What do you want to do? (Use arrow keys)
       View chain addresses
   >   Check on-chain balance
       Get network info
       Get validator info
       Move assets from C-chain to P-chain
       Move assets from P-chain to C-chain
       Add a validator node
   ```
   As an example, select **Check on-chain balance** and press **Enter**.
   The tool displays the C-chain and P-chain balances before exiting.

### Check validator info

1. Note down the `NodeID` of the validator you want to stake to:
   - If you created the validator, retrieve its `NodeID`, `publicKey` and `proofOfPossession` by running:

     ```bash
     curl \
      --location 'http://localhost:9650/ext/info' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"info.getNodeID" }'
     ```

   - If you want to stake to somebody else's validator, get a JSON list of all validators by running:

     ```bash
     flare-stake-tool info validators
     ```

2. Note down the desired staking **start time** and **end time**: When staking to an existing validator, both these times must be inside the period when the validator is active.
   If you specify a period when the validator is inactive, your transaction on the P-chain reverts.

## Move funds to P-chain

1. Check your C-chain and P-chain balances by selecting the **Check on-chain balance** option when executing:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   Your currently available funds on the C-chain and P-chain are shown in the last lines. Funds currently staked are locked and are not reflected in the P-chain balance.
   They will become automatically available when the staking period expires.

   ```plaintext
   ? How do you want to connect your wallet? Ledger
   You already have an existing Ctx file with the following parameters -
   Public Key: ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●
   Network: flare
   Eth Address: 0x●●●●●●●●
   ? Do you wish to continue with this? yes
   ? What do you want to do? Check on-chain balance
   Using network: flare
   Balances on the network "flare"
   // highlight-next-line
   C-chain 0x●●●●●●●●: 100000.0 FLR
   // highlight-next-line
   P-chain P-flare●●●●●●●●: 50000.0 FLR
   ```

   If you already have funds on the P-chain, skip the next step.

2. Select the **Move assets from C-chain to P-chain** option when executing:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   You are asked the amount of FLR you want to transfer:

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do? Move assets from C-chain to P-chain
   ? Enter amount (in FLR): 50000
   ? Enter fees (in FLR): (1)
   ```

   :::warning[Transaction Fees]

   When transferring from the C-chain to the P-chain, transaction fees are wholly paid from the C-chain.
   Make sure you leave enough funds on the C-chain after the transfer, or it will fail.

   :::

3. Transfers between chains are made of two operations: an **export** from the C-chain followed by an **import** to the P-chain. Therefore, you are asked to confirm two transactions.

   ```plaintext
   // highlight-next-line
   Please approve export transaction
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating export transaction...
   Transaction finalized!
   // highlight-next-line
   Please approve import transaction
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating import transaction...
   ```

If you encounter any issues during this process, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Stake

1. After you have funds on the P-chain, execute the following command and select the appropriate option:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   - If you are going to delegate to your own node (self-bonding), select **Add a validator node**.

   - If you are going to stake to another node (delegation), select **Delegate to a validator node** (You may need to scroll down to see this option).

2. You then need to provide the following information:
   - **amount**: Amount must be provided in FLR units.
   - **NodeID** and **end time**: Use the values noted down from the [setup](#setup).

   If you are adding a validator node, you also need to provide the proof of possession **BLS public key** and **BLS signature**.

   Retrieve these details using the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.getNodeID"
   }' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info | jq
   ```

   The output will be similar to the following:

   ```json
   {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "result": {
         "nodeID": "NodeID-CGeHNYkQJX4qb21x976PEcNt3FqsUZfXL",
         "nodePOP": {
            popBLSPublicKey ---> "publicKey": "0xb6a40b905128c010e4d7b0cbd6f7b7912a1da9a6022a8c720887b5183a4f2f109c678027316ae4757f7f987f1fa5addb",
            popBLSSignature ---> "proofOfPossession": "0xb9394ef2992a77a3b70440c2fdb3b2a53f23fb8579460322b69a290bf3de7fafc2665b155b5300c08a1e7bcb45bb7eaf0ca7f596650b0423f61f329744e37f6908c1d7e4191378d5f0ff7fd7f8abd02d37a2be9dd95635a0b1f744b043cb5d9e"
         }
      },
      "id": 1
   }
   ```

3. If you selected **Add a validator node**, you have to set the **delegation fee**. This is the percentage of all rewards that the node owner keeps.
   The rest is split proportionally between the self-bond and all delegators that contributed stake. 10 means 10%, so the maximum value is 100.

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do? Add a validator node
   ? Enter amount (in FLR): 50000
   ? Enter Node NodeId (E.g. NodeID-FQKTLuZHEsjCxPeFTFgsojsucmdyNDsz1): NodeID-●●●●●●●●
   ? Enter end time(E.g. 1693185095): ●●●●●●●●
   ? Enter delegation fee(E.g. 10): 10
   ? Please enter the popBLSPublicKey: 0x●●●●●●●●
   ? Please enter the popBLSSignature: 0x●●●●●●●●
   ```

4. You are then asked to confirm the staking transaction on your hardware wallet.

   ```plaintext
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating export transaction...
   // highlight-next-line
   Please review and sign the transaction on your ledger device...
   Sending transaction to the node...
   Transaction with id ●●●●●●●● sent to the node
   Finished execution
   ```

   Your stake is now locked and will start accruing rewards after the configured start time arrives.
   When the end time arrives, the funds will be automatically unlocked.

If you encounter any issues, refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Check Stake

1. You can now double-check that the operation has been properly registered by looking at the current list of validators:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool info validators > validators.txt
   ```

   This creates a file called `validators.txt`. Open it and search for the line containing the **P-chain address** of your account. If you don't remember your address run:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool info addresses
   ```

2. If your account has stake on any node, you will find a section similar to:

   ```json
   {
     "txID": "28Yf5yQ3xt9yaMvfZ1RP5jkCkT4y2pfD86UheZUHFVng2tFcWd",
     "startTime": "1688569201",
     "endTime": "1696345201",
     "stakeAmount": "16750000000000000",
     "nodeID": "NodeID-C6i8mruq11VdxGQ7tiUBgrRqoLBot86df",
     "rewardOwner": {
       "locktime": "0",
       "threshold": "1",
       "addresses": [
         // highlight-next-line
         "P-flare19c8zfml39x6efnw5j90nl85dmwdqhluwhrxz9g"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   Check that the `stakeAmount` (in wei), `nodeID`, `startTime`, and `endTime` match the values you configured. If you have multiple active stakes, your address will show up multiple times.

## Move funds back to C-chain

1. Finally, you also have the option to move your P-chain funds back to the C-chain where they can participate in the wider ecosystem. You can only transfer P-chain funds that are not currently locked in any stake. Select the **Move assets from P-chain to C-chain** option when executing:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

2. You are asked the amount of FLR you want to transfer:

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do? Move assets from P-chain to C-chain
   ? Enter amount (in FLR): 50000
   ```

   :::warning[Transaction Fees]

   When transferring from the P to the C-chain, transaction fees are paid from BOTH chains.
   Make sure you leave enough funds on both chains after the transfer, or it will fail.

   :::

3. Again, the transfer between the two chains require you to confirm two transactions.

   ```plaintext
   // highlight-next-line
   Please approve export transaction
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating export transaction...
   ? Enter fees (in FLR): (1)
   // highlight-next-line
   Please approve import transaction
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating import transaction...
   Finished execution
   ```

If you encounter any issues, refer to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Claiming staking rewards

At the end of every reward epoch, participants are rewarded according to how well their chosen validator performed in that period, but these rewards are not claimable yet. Every 4 reward epochs, rewards are accumulated in a dedicated smart contract and can then be claimed from the Flare Stake CLI tool:

1. Select the **Claim staking rewards** option when executing:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   You are shown the amount of pending rewards (in wei) and are asked how much you want to claim (in FLR):

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do? Claim staking rewards
   State of rewards for 0x●●●●●●●●:
   Total rewards: 2000.0 FLR
   Claimed rewards: 1010.0 FLR
   Unclaimed rewards: 990.0 FLR
   ```

2. Claim all or a portion of the rewards and optionally choose to wrap them or not:

   <Tabs groupId="claim" block>

   <TabItem value="all" label="Claim All" default>

   ```plaintext
   ? Do you want to claim all unclaimed rewards? (total unclaimed: 990.0 FLR) Yes
   ? Should claimed rewards be wrapped? Yes
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="partial" label="Claim Partial">

   ```plaintext
   ? Do you want to claim all unclaimed rewards? (total unclaimed: 990.0 FLR) No
   ? Please enter the amount to claim: 100
   ? Should claimed rewards be wrapped? Yes
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

3. Decide the recipient address for the rewards - defaults to the address you used to connect to the Flare Stake Tool.

   ```plaintext
   ? Please enter the recipient address (default address is reward owner): 0x●●●●●●●●
   ```

   You are then asked to confirm the staking transaction on your hardware wallet.

   ```plaintext
   Using network: flare
   Creating claim transaction...
   Signing transaction...
   // highlight-next-line
   Transaction with hash 0x●●●●●●●● built and sent to the network
   ```

## Transfer P-chain funds to another P-chain address

1. You can transfer P-chain funds to another P-chain address by selecting the **Transfer funds to another P-chain address** option:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do?
   ❯ Transfer funds to another P-chain address
   Claim staking rewards
   Quit
   ```

2. Select the amount to transfer and the destination P-chain address:

   ```plaintext
   ? Enter amount (in FLR): 100
   ? Please enter the destination P-chain address: P-flare●●●●●●●●
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating transfer transaction...
   ```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>T1. Cannot connect to Ledger device, no Device, cannot retrieve addresses, or similar.</summary>

Make sure:

- The device is connected, the Avalanche app is opened, and it shows the "Avalanche Ready" message.
- No other application like Ledger Live or MetaMask is connected to the device.
- The device is not in stand-by mode.
- You are not running on Windows from a Linux terminal (WSL). Use a native Windows console instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary>T2. Insufficient funds.</summary>

Make sure enough funds will remain after a transaction to pay for the transaction fees.
If too much time has elapsed between the transaction's creation and its confirmation on the Ledger, the calculated fee might be incorrect.
Try the operation again. The network might be congested and the calculated fees might not be high enough.
Try the operation again after a while.

</details>

<details>
<summary>T3. Import transaction failed and the funds have vanished.</summary>

Transfer operations require [an export and an import transaction](#move-funds-to-p-chain).
If the export succeeds, but then the import fails, it looks like the funds have disappeared from both chains, but they are still retrievable.

Import the funds using the interactive tool:

- If you are moving funds from the C-chain to the P-chain:

  ```bash
  flare-stake-tool interactive
  ```

  ```plaintext
  ? What do you want to do?
    ❯ Import Funds (in case export fails for either P chain or C chain)
  ```

  ```plaintext
  ? Please select the destination chain to which you want to import your funds? (Use arrow keys)
    ❯ P
  ```

- If you are moving funds from the P-chain to the C-chain:

  ```bash
  flare-stake-tool interactive
  ```

  ```plaintext
  ? What do you want to do?
    ❯ Import Funds (in case export fails for either P chain or C chain)
  ```

  ```plaintext
  ? Please select the destination chain to which you want to import your funds? (Use arrow keys)
    ❯ C
  ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>T4. Unsupported digital routine.</summary>

If you get the following error message:

```text
E: Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
```

Make sure you are using the correct Node.js version, as advised in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

You can find out the version of Node.js you are running with the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

</details>

## FAQs

<details>
<summary>F1. How do I register my address manually?</summary>

You can register your address manually using the block explorer and the `AddressBinder` smart contract.

1. Retrieve the public key that generated the accounts you want to use.
   From a terminal, run:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool info addresses
   ```

   Copy the hexadecimal string starting with `0x` in the last line.

   ```plaintext
   Using network: flare
   Addresses on the network "flare"
   P-chain address: P-flare●●●●●●●●
   C-chain address hex: 0x●●●●●●●●
   // highlight-next-line
   secp256k1 public key: 0x●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●
   ```

2. Retrieve the `AddressBinder` contract address from the [`FlareContractRegistry`](/network/solidity-reference).
3. Enter the address of the `AddressBinder` contract in the block explorer, and go to the **Write Contract** tab.
4. Click on **Connect Wallet**. You do not need to use the same account as the one you are binding.
5. Locate the `registerPublicKey` method and paste the public key from step 1 into the `_publicKey` field.
6. Click on **Write** and confirm the transaction from your wallet.

If the transaction is successful, your account's P-chain and C-chain addresses are now bound.

</details>

<details>
<summary>F2. How do I claim rewards manually?</summary>

You can claim rewards manually using the block explorer and the `ValidatorRewardManager` smart contract.

1. Retrieve the `ValidatorRewardManager` contract address from the [`FlareContractRegistry`](/network/solidity-reference).
2. Enter the address of the `ValidatorRewardManager` contract in the block explorer, and go to the **Write Contract** tab.
3. Click on **Connect Wallet**. You need to connect the account for which you are claiming.
4. Locate the `claim` method and enter the following information:
   - `_rewardOwner`: C-chain address that accrued the rewards.
   - `_recipient`: Address where the rewards must be sent.
   - `_rewardAmount`: Amount to claim. Find the pending amount using the `getStateOfRewards` method in the **Read Contract** tab.
   - `_wrap`: Whether the rewards should be also wrapped, as a convenience.
5. Click on **Write** and confirm the transaction from your wallet.

If the transaction is successful, the reward is transferred to the specified recipient.
