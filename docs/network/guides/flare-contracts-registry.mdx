## Overview

Flare provides a registry of enshrined protocol contracts such as `FtsoV2`, `FdcHub`, and `RandomNumberV2`.  
To ensure reliability, these contract addresses should **always be retrieved dynamically** via the **Flare Contract Registry** rather than hardcoding them.
Using the registry ensures your contracts, and dApps are resistant to future upgrades and cannot be misled by offchain or unverified sources.

## Flare Contract Registry Address

The [`FlareContractRegistry`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) smart contract is the **only trusted source** for resolving official protocol contract addresses.

The registry is deployed at the same address across all Flare networks:

<Tabs block>
  <TabItem value="flare" label="Flare Mainnet" default>
    <SolidityReference
      network="FlareMainnet"
      contractNames={contracts}
      renderAbi={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="coston2" label="Flare Testnet Coston2">
    <SolidityReference
      network="FlareTestnetCoston2"
      contractNames={contracts}
      renderAbi={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="songbird" label="Songbird Canary-Network">
    <SolidityReference
      network="SongbirdCanaryNetwork"
      contractNames={contracts}
      renderAbi={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="coston" label="Songbird Testnet Coston">
    <SolidityReference
      network="SongbirdTestnetCoston"
      contractNames={contracts}
      renderAbi={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Retrieval Methods

In the following code example, the `RandomNumberFetcher` contract retrieves the address of `RandomNumberV2` using the three approaches described below.

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/RandomNumberFetcher.sol">
  {RandomNumberFetcher}
</CodeBlock>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Remix fileName="RandomNumberFetcher.sol">Open in Remix</Remix>

### ðŸ”´ Hardcoded Address

The `getRandomNumberHardcoded` function below uses a hardcoded address to create an interface instance. Not recommended in production.

:::warning

- Never hardcode contract addresses in production.
- Avoid using contract addresses obtained from unofficial sources like DMs, social media, or third-party websites.
- Instead of passing contract addresses directly into constructors, retrieve them dynamically, as shown below.
  :::

### Flare Contract Registry Smart Contract

The Flare Contract Registry smart contract exposes [`getContractAddressByName`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getcontractaddressbyname) or [`getContractAddressByHash`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getcontractaddressbyhash) to retrieve the address of the contract.

In the code example above, the `getRandomNumberViaRegistryName` function uses the `getContractAddressByName` method to retrieve the address of `RandomNumberV2`.

### Contract Registry Library

The [Flare periphery package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) package includes a helper utility [`ContractRegistry`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-solidity-periphery-package-mirror/blob/master/flare/ContractRegistry.sol).
This library provides shorthand functions for accessing common protocol contracts, e.g., `ContractRegistry.getRandomNumberV2()`.

In the example, the `getRandomNumberViaContractLibrary` function demonstrates this approach.

:::tip
If the contract you are looking for does not have a shorthand method in
the `ContractRegistry` library, you can fall back to using
`getContractAddressByName` or call `getAllContracts` to list all registered
contracts.
