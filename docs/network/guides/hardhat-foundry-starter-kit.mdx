The starter kit includes a basic setup for configuring Hardhat and Foundry, along with examples on how to compile, test and deploy smart contracts on Flare.

## Hardhat

### Getting Started

If you're new to Hardhat, review Hardhat's documentation on [Getting Started with Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview).

Install the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v18.0 or higher
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

:::tip

[Hardhat for Visual Studio Code](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-vscode) is the official Hardhat extension that adds advanced support for Solidity to VSCode. If you use VSCode, give it a try!

:::

:::info

OpenZeppelin version `4.x` is used for this Starter Kit, ensure you refer to the correct version of the [OpenZeppelin documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/).

### Setup

#### Cloning and installing dependencies

Clone the [template repository](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter) and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter.git
cd flare-hardhat-starter
```

Install the project dependencies.

<Tabs groupId="jsmanager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Setting up environment variables

Copy the example environment file and update it with your settings.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and set your `PRIVATE_KEY`.

```text
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

:::danger

- Never share your private keys.
- Never put your private keys in source code.
- Never commit private keys to a Git repository.

:::

### Compile, test and deploy

Compile the smart contracts to generate the necessary artifacts.

<Tabs groupId="jsmanager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

    ```bash
    yarn hardhat compile
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command compiles all `.sol` files in the `/contracts` folder and generates artifacts needed for testing.

#### Testing your contracts

Run the provided test suite to ensure everything is set up correctly.

<Tabs groupId="jsmanager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

    ```bash
    yarn hardhat test
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Deploying your contracts

Review and modify `hardhat.config.ts` to specify the networks you want to deploy to. The details for Flare Mainnet, Flare Testnet Coston2, Songbird Canary-Network and Songbird Testnet Coston are already included.

Optionally you can add the API keys for either [Flarescan](https://flarescan.com) or [Flare Explorer](https://flarescan.com) in the `.env` file.

  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/tryDeployment.ts
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
  
    ```bash
    yarn npx hardhat run scripts/tryDeployment.ts
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Foundry

### Getting Started

If you're new to Foundry, review Foundry's documentation on [Getting Started with Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh).

Install the following prerequisites:

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html)

### Setup

#### Cloning and installing dependencies

Clone the [template repository](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-foundry-starter) and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-foundry-starter.git
cd flare-foundry-starter
```

Install the project dependencies.

```bash
forge install
```

#### Setting up environment variables

Add `PRIVATE_KEY` to your environment variables.

```text
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

:::danger

- Never share your private keys.
- Never put your private keys in source code.
- Never commit private keys to a Git repository.

:::

### Compile, test and deploy

Compile the smart contracts to generate the necessary artifacts.

```bash
forge build
```

This command compiles all `.sol` files in the `/src` folder and generates artifacts needed for testing.

#### Testing contracts

Run the provided test suite to ensure everything is set up correctly.

```bash
forge test
```

#### Deploying your contracts

Run the deployment script using Foundry:

```bash
forge script script/Counter.s.sol --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```

Replace `<RPC_URL>` with the RPC endpoint of the network you are deploying to. A list of RPC endpoints for Flare networks can be found in Flare's [Network Configuration](/network/overview#configuration).
