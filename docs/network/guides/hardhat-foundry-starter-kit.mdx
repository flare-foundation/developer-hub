The starter kit includes a basic setup for configuring Hardhat and Foundry, along with examples on how to compile, test and deploy smart contracts on Flare.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs groupId="framework">
  <TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>

    If you're new to Hardhat, review Hardhat's documentation on [Getting Started with Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview).

    Install the following tools:

    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v18.0 or higher
    - [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

    :::tip

    [Hardhat for Visual Studio Code](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-vscode) is the official Hardhat extension that adds advanced support for Solidity to VSCode. If you use VSCode, give it a try!

    If you're new to Foundry, review Foundry's documentation on [Getting Started with Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh).

    Install the following tools:

    - [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

## Clone the template

<Tabs groupId="framework">
  <TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat">

    1. Clone the [flare-hardhat-starter](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter) and navigate into the project directory.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter.git
        cd flare-hardhat-starter
        ```

    2. Install the project dependencies.

        ```bash
        yarn
        ```

        or alternatively:

        ```bash
        npm install --force
        ```

    3. Copy the example environment file and update it with your settings.

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    4. Open the `.env` file and set your `PRIVATE_KEY`.

        ```text
        PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
        ```

        :::danger

        - Never share your private keys.
        - Never put your private keys in source code.
        - Never commit private keys to a Git repository.

        :::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

    1. Clone the [flare-foundry-starter](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-foundry-starter) and navigate into the project directory.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-foundry-starter.git
        cd flare-foundry-starter
        ```

    2. Install the project dependencies.

        ```bash
        forge soldeer install
        ```

    3. You might need to modify `remappings.txt` so `/src` paths are read correctly, e.g.:

        ```bash
        @openzeppelin-contracts/=dependencies/@openzeppelin-contracts-5.2.0-rc.1/
        flare-periphery/=dependencies/flare-periphery-0.0.1/
        forge-std/=dependencies/forge-std-1.9.5/src/
        forge-std/=dependencies/forge-std-1.9.5/
        surl/=dependencies/surl-0.0.0/src/
        surl/=dependencies/surl-0.0.0/
        ```

    4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your settings.

        Add `PRIVATE_KEY` to your environment variables.

        ```text
        PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
        ```

        :::danger

        - Never share your private keys.
        - Never put your private keys in source code.
        - Never commit private keys to a Git repository.

        :::

    5. You now need to add the information from the `.env` file to your bash profile:

        ```bash
        source .env
        ```

        You need to do this every time you open a new terminal or change the `.env` file.

## Compile, test and deploy

<Tabs groupId="framework">
  <TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat">

    1. Compile the smart contracts to generate the necessary artifacts.

        ```bash
        yarn hardhat compile
        ```

        or alternatively:

        ```bash
        npx hardhat compile
        ```

        This command compiles all `.sol` files in the `/contracts` folder and generates artifacts needed for testing.

    2. Run the provided test suite to ensure everything is set up correctly.

        ```bash
        yarn hardhat test
        ```

        or alternatively:

        ```bash
        npx hardhat test
        ```

    3. Review and modify `hardhat.config.ts` to specify the networks you want to deploy to. The details for Flare Mainnet, Flare Testnet Coston2, Songbird Canary-Network and Songbird Testnet Coston are already included.

    Optionally you can add the API keys for [Flare Explorer](https://flare-explorer.flare.network) in the `.env` file.

        ```bash
        yarn hardhat run scripts/tryDeployment.ts
        ```

        or alternatively:

        ```bash
        npx hardhat run scripts/tryDeployment.ts
        ```

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Flare into Hardhat.

  <TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

    1. Compile the smart contracts to generate the necessary artifacts.

        ```bash
        forge build
        ```

        This command compiles all `.sol` files in the `/src` folder and generates artifacts needed for testing.

    2. Run the provided test suite to ensure everything is set up correctly.

        ```bash
        forge test
        ```

    3. Run the deployment script using Foundry:

        ```bash
        forge script script/Counter.s.sol --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
        ```

        Replace `<RPC_URL>` with the RPC endpoint of the network you are deploying to. A list of RPC endpoints for Flare networks can be found in Flare's [Network Configuration](/network/overview#configuration).

    Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Flare into Foundry.
