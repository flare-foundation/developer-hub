The **F**lare **S**ystems **P**rotocol (**FSP**) is a foundational infrastructure designed to support Flare's enshrined protocols (technically referred to as sub-protocols).
Its primary goal is to facilitate secure, efficient, and decentralized consensus mechanisms through weighted voting by a select group of entities known as voters.
These voters are off-chain participants who accrue vote power from the Flare community via delegations of wrapped FLR tokens (WFLR) or stakes.

FSP ensures that agreements on off-chain data or calculations are reached securely and fairly, enabling the reliable operation of sub-protocols
like the [Flare Time Series Oracle](/ftso/overview) and the [Flare Data Connector](/fdc/overview).

**Key FSP Features:**

- **Decentralized Governance**: Through a weighted voting system involving a diverse set of voters.
- **Efficient Data Management**: By offloading complex calculations off-chain and minimizing on-chain storage requirements.
- **Robust Reward Mechanisms**: Incentivizing participation and penalizing delays or non-compliance to maintain network health.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to support additional sub-protocols and future enhancements like C-chain staking.
- **Security**: Implements mechanisms to prevent malicious behavior and ensures data integrity through Merkle proofs.
