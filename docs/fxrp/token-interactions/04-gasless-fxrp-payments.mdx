This guide describes how to create a system for gasless FXRP (FAsset) transfers on Flare.
Users sign payment requests off-chain with [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), and a relayer submits them on-chain and pays gas on their behalf.

### EIP-3009 and EIP-712

[EIP-3009](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3009) (Transfer with Authorization) extends [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) with meta-transactions. The token holder signs an authorization off-chain, and a relayer executes the transfer on-chain and pays gas.
This guide uses a **custom [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) payment message** and a forwarder contract instead of EIP-3009 on the token itself.
The forwarder pulls FXRP from the user (after a one-time approval) and sends it to the recipient.
The relayer pays gas and can charge a fee in FXRP.

## Project setup

Create a new [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project or use the [Flare Hardhat Starter](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) kit.

Install needed dependencies:

```bash
npm install ethers viem express cors dotenv
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts
```

Add the following files to your project:

### Gasless Payment Forwarder Contract

Save as `contracts/GaslessPaymentForwarder.sol`:

<details>
<summary>View GaslessPaymentForwarder.sol</summary>

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/GaslessPaymentForwarder.sol">
  {GaslessPaymentForwarder}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

#### How the contract works

1. Define libraries and state.
2. Define events.
3. Define errors.
4. Implement the contract constructor that sets the EIP-712 domain, owner, and initial relayer fee.
5. Implement the `fxrp` function that returns the FXRP token from the Flare registry.
6. Define the `executePayment` function that executes a gasless payment.
7. Hash the request (type hash + from, to, amount, fee, nonce, deadline) and get the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) digest.
8. Recover the signer from the signature with ECDSA.
9. Require signer from the payment request.
10. Require allowance is sufficient for the total amount (amount + fee).
11. Transfer amount from sender to recipient.
12. Transfer fee from sender to relayer (msg.sender); emit PaymentExecuted.
13. Define the view functions to get the nonce, domain separator, and payment request hash.
14. Define the functions to set the relayer authorization and fee.

Run the following command to compile the contract and generate the typechain-types:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Utilities

Save as `utils/payment.ts`.

It uses the `typechain-types` generated by the previous command.

<details>
<summary>View utils/payment.ts</summary>

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="utils/payment.ts">
  {PaymentUtils}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

### Relayer Service

This is a relayer service that will submit payment requests to the Flare blockchain and pay gas on behalf of the user.

Save as `relayer/index.ts` to start the relayer service:

<details>
<summary>View relayer/index.ts</summary>

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="relayer/index.ts">
  {Relayer}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

### Deploy Script

Save as `scripts/deploy.ts` to deploy the [`GaslessPaymentForwarder`](/fxrp/token-interactions/gasless-fxrp-payments#gasless-payment-forwarder-contract) contract:

<details>
<summary>View scripts/deploy.ts</summary>

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/deploy.ts">
  {DeployScript}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

### Example Flow

Use `scripts/example-usage.ts` to run the example flow:

<details>
<summary>View scripts/example-usage.ts</summary>

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/example-usage.ts">
  {ExampleUsage}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

The example flow tests the system and executes the following steps:

1. Check the user's balance and allowance.
2. Approve the forwarder to spend FXRP if needed.
3. Create a payment request.
4. Submit the payment request to the relayer.
5. Check the payment status.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Deployer private key (for deployment) |
| `RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Relayer wallet (pays gas, receives FXRP fees) |
| `USER_PRIVATE_KEY` | User wallet for testing |
| `FORWARDER_ADDRESS` | Deployed contract address (set after deploy) |
| `RPC_URL` | Flare network RPC (e.g. Coston2 testnet) |
| `RELAYER_URL` | Relayer HTTP URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) |

## Deploy and run

### Compile Contracts

Run the following command to compile the contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploy the Forwarder

Deploy the [`GaslessPaymentForwarder`](/fxrp/token-interactions/gasless-fxrp-payments#gasless-payment-forwarder-contract) contract to Coston2 (testnet):

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network coston2
```

Set `FORWARDER_ADDRESS` in `.env` to the deployed contract address.

### Start the Relayer

Run the following command to start the relayer service.

The relayer is an Express server that submits payment requests on the Flare blockchain and pays gas on behalf of the user.

```bash
npx ts-node relayer/index.ts
```

**Main relayer backend endpoints:**

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/execute` | Execute single payment |
| GET | `/nonce/:address` | Get nonce for address |
| GET | `/fee` | Get the relayer fee |

### Run the example Flow

Run the following command to run the example:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/example-usage.ts
```

This script will execute the following steps:

1. Check the user's balance and allowance.
2. Approve the forwarder to spend FXRP if needed.
3. Create a payment request.
4. Submit the payment request to the relayer.
5. Check the payment status.

You should see the following output:
