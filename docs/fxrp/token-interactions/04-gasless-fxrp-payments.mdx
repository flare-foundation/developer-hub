This guide explains how to set up gasless FXRP (FAsset) transfers on Flare.
Users sign payment requests off-chain with [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) typed data, and a relayer submits them on-chain and pays gas on their behalf.

### Standards explained

[EIP-3009](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3009) (Transfer with Authorization) extends [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) with meta-transactions.
The token holder signs an authorization off-chain, and a relayer executes the transfer on-chain and pays gas.

This guide uses a custom [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) payment message and a forwarder contract instead of EIP-3009 on the token itself.
The forwarder pulls FXRP from the user (after a one-time approval) and sends it to the recipient.
The relayer pays gas and can charge a fee in FXRP.

## Project setup

Create a new [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project or use the [Flare Hardhat Starter](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) kit.

Install needed dependencies:

```bash
npm install ethers viem express cors dotenv
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts
```

Add the following files to your project:

### Gasless Payment Forwarder Contract

Save as `contracts/GaslessPaymentForwarder.sol` to create the forwarder smart contract that will be used to execute gasless payments.

<details>
<summary>View `contracts/GaslessPaymentForwarder.sol`</summary>

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/GaslessPaymentForwarder.sol">
  {GaslessPaymentForwarder}
</CodeBlock>

**How the contract works**

1. Define libraries and state.
2. Define events.
3. Defines errors.
4. Implements the contract constructor that sets the EIP-712 domain, owner, and initial relayer fee.
5. Implements the `fxrp` function that returns the FXRP token from the Flare registry.
6. Defines the `executePayment` function that executes a gasless payment.
7. Hashes the request (type hash + from, to, amount, fee, nonce, deadline) and gets the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) digest.
8. Recovers the signer from the signature with ECDSA.
9. Requires the signer of the payment request.
10. Requires a sufficient allowance for the total amount (amount + fee).
11. Transfers the amount from the sender to the recipient.
12. Transfers fee from sender to relayer (msg.sender); emits `PaymentExecuted`.
13. Defines the view functions to get the nonce, domain separator, and payment request hash.
14. Defines the function to set the relater authorization.
15. Define the function to set the relayer fee.

Run the following command to compile the contract and generate the typechain-types:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Utilities

Save as `utils/payment.ts` to create the utility functions that will be used to create and sign payment requests.

:::info

This utility uses the `typechain-types` generated by the previous command.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="utils/payment.ts">
  {PaymentUtils}
</CodeBlock>

**Code Breakdown**

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Define the needed constants and EIP-712 types.
3. Define types for sign params, payment request, approval result, and user status.
4. Parse human-readable amount to raw bigint with decimals.
5. Format the raw amount to a readable string with decimals.
6. Get FXRP decimals from the forwarder and token contract.
7. Get the current nonce for a user from the forwarder.
8. Get the minimum relayer fee from the forwarder.
9. Sign the payment message with EIP-712 and return the signature.
10. Create a full payment request: fetch nonce and fee, set deadline, sign, and return payload for the relayer.
11. Approve the forwarder to spend FXRP.
12. Check user balance, allowance, nonce, and whether approval is needed.

### Relayer Service

This is a relayer service that submits payment requests to the Flare blockchain and pays gas on behalf of the user.

Save as `relayer/index.ts` to start the relayer service.

<details>
<summary>View `relayer/index.ts`</summary>

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="relayer/index.ts">
  {Relayer}
</CodeBlock>

**Code Breakdown**

1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Define EIP-712 domain, payment request types, and other network configurations.
3. Define `RelayerConfig`, `PaymentRequest`, and `ExecuteResult` types.
4. Implement the `GaslessRelayer` class to interact with the forwarder contract.
5. Execute gasless payment: normalize and validate request, recover signer with EIP-712, validate request (balance, allowance, deadline), staticCall, then recheck nonce, estimate gas with buffer, call executePayment, wait for receipt, return result.
6. Validate request: check deadline against chain time, check sender FXRP balance and allowance, check fee meets minimum.
7. Get nonce for an address from the forwarder contract.
8. Get the minimum relayer fee from the forwarder contract.
9. Get FXRP token decimals from the forwarder and token contract.
10. Get the relayer FLR balance for gas.
11. Start Express server.
12. Main function to read environment variables, create a relayer, log FLR balance, and start the server.
13. Run the main function to start the relayer service.

### Deploy Script

Save as `scripts/deploy.ts` to deploy the [`GaslessPaymentForwarder`](/fxrp/token-interactions/gasless-fxrp-payments#gasless-payment-forwarder-contract) contract.

<details>
<summary>View scripts/deploy.ts</summary>

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/deploy.ts">
  {DeployScript}
</CodeBlock>

**Code Breakdown**

1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Define default relayer fee constant in FXRP base units.
3. Get deployer signer and balance; log address and FLR balance.
4. Deploy `GaslessPaymentForwarder` contract with the relayer fee (FXRP comes from the Flare Contract Registry) and wait for deployment, and get the contract address.
5. Get FXRP token address and decimals from the forwarder.
   Format fee for display.
   Log deployment summary (network, contract, FXRP, owner, fee).
6. Verify contract on block explorer.
7. Run main function.

</details>

### Example Flow

Use `scripts/example-usage.ts` to run the example flow.

<details>
<summary>View scripts/example-usage.ts</summary>

</details>

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

| Variable              | Description                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `PRIVATE_KEY`         | Deployer private key (for deployment)           |
| `RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY` | Relayer wallet (pays gas, receives FXRP fees)   |
| `USER_PRIVATE_KEY`    | User wallet for testing                         |
| `FORWARDER_ADDRESS`   | Deployed contract address (set after deploy)    |
| `RPC_URL`             | Flare network RPC (e.g. Coston2 testnet)        |
| `RELAYER_URL`         | Relayer HTTP URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) |

## Deploy and run

### Compile Contracts

Run the following command to compile the contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploy the Forwarder

Deploy the [`GaslessPaymentForwarder`](/fxrp/token-interactions/gasless-fxrp-payments#gasless-payment-forwarder-contract) contract to Coston2 (testnet):

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network coston2
```

Set `FORWARDER_ADDRESS` in `.env` to the deployed contract address.

### Start the Relayer

Run the following command to start the relayer service.

The relayer is an Express server that submits payment requests on the Flare blockchain and pays gas on behalf of the user.

```bash
npx ts-node relayer/index.ts
```

**Main relayer backend endpoints:**

| Method | Path              | Description            |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| POST   | `/execute`        | Execute single payment |
| GET    | `/nonce/:address` | Get nonce for address  |
| GET    | `/fee`            | Get the relayer fee    |

### Run the example Flow

Run the following command to run the example:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/example-usage.ts
```

This script will execute the following steps:

1. Checks the user's balance and allowance.
2. Approves the forwarder to spend FXRP if needed.
3. Creates a payment request.
4. Submits the payment request to the relayer.
5. Checks the payment status.
