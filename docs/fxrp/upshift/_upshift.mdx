[Upshift](https://upshift.finance) is a yield-generating protocol that supports FXRP through strategy-driven vaults on Flare.
It provides [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) style vaults that allow users to deposit FXRP and earn yield generated from on-chain DeFi strategies, while abstracting away strategy execution and risk management.

Upshift vaults support both instant and requested redemptions, depending on available liquidity.
Users receive vault shares that represent their proportional ownership of the vault's assets, with yield accruing as share value increases over time.

[Upshift vault](https://app.upshift.finance/pools/14/0x373D7d201C8134D4a2f7b5c63560da217e3dEA28) is part of the XRP finance stack on Flare Network.
It inherits the transparency model of the [FAssets](/fassets/overview) system: minting and redemption are proof-backed, and vault interactions are recorded on-chain.

- **Funds are on-chain:** User deposits, vault balances, withdrawal requests, and claims are executed as smart contract state changes on Flare.
  You can verify all vault holdings on [DeBank](https://debank.com/profile/0xEDb7B1e92B8D3621b46843AD024949F10438374B) portfolio tracker.
- **User ownership is verifiable:** A user's position is represented directly on-chain and can be queried from smart contracts.
- **Instruction flow is auditable:** XRPL-triggered actions are executed on Flare via [Smart Accounts](/smart-accounts/overview) with [Flare Data Connector](/fdc/overview) backed verification and onchain execution.
  You can verify all smart account activity on the [Flare Systems Explorer](https://flare-systems-explorer.flare.network/smart-accounts).
