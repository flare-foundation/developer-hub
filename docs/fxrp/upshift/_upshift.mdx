[Upshift](https://upshift.finance) is a yield-generating protocol that supports FXRP through strategy-driven vaults on Flare.
It provides [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)] style vaults that allow users to deposit FXRP and earn yield generated from on-chain DeFi strategies, while abstracting away strategy execution and risk management.

Upshift vaults support both instant and requested redemptions, depending on available liquidity.
Users receive vault shares that represent their proportional ownership of the vault's assets, with yield accruing as share value increases over time.
