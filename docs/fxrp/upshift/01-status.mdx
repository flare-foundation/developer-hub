This guide demonstrates how to retrieve information about an Upshift vault, including vault configuration, LP token info, user balances, and withdrawal epoch information.

The Upshift vault is an [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) style tokenized vault compatible with [FAssets](/fassets/overview).

## Prerequisites

- [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit)
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts)
- Understanding of [FAssets](/fassets/overview)

## Upshift Vault Status Script

The following script retrieves and displays information about the Upshift vault:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/upshift/status.ts">
  {UpshiftStatus}
</CodeBlock>

## Script Breakdown

The `main()` function executes the following steps:

1. **Initialize:** Gets the user account and logs the vault and user addresses.
2. **Connect to vault:** Creates an instance of the Upshift vault contract.
3. **Get reference asset info:** Retrieves the vault's reference asset (FXRP) address, symbol, and decimals.
4. **Get LP token info:** Retrieves the vault's LP token address, which represents user shares.
5. **Get vault configuration:** Fetches key vault parameters.
6. **Get withdrawal epoch info:** Retrieves the current withdrawal epoch (year, month, day) and claimable epoch.
7. **Get user balances:** Shows the user's reference asset balance and LP token balance.
8. **Check allowances:** Displays the user's token allowances to the vault for both the reference asset and LP token.

## Running the Script

To run the Upshift vault status script:

1. Ensure you have the [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) set up.
2. Update the `VAULT_ADDRESS` constant with the correct vault address for your network.
3. Run the script using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/upshift/status.ts --network coston2
```

## Output

The script outputs the following information about the Upshift vault:

```bash
