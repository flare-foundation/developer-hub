## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to deposit assets into a Firelight vault.
The Firelight vault implements the [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) standard, which allows users to deposit assets (e.g., FXRP) and receive vault shares in return.

Depositing assets is the process of transferring assets to the vault and receiving vault shares, which represent your proportional ownership of the vault's assets.

## Prerequisites

- [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit)
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts)
- Understanding of [FAssets](/fassets/overview)
- Sufficient asset balance (e.g., FXRP) to deposit into the vault.

## Firelight Vaults Deposit Script

The following script demonstrates how to deposit assets into the Firelight vault:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/firelight/deposit.ts">
  {FirelightDeposit}
</CodeBlock>

## Script Breakdown

The `main()` function executes the following steps:

1. **Get the account:** Retrieves the signer account from the Hardhat environment.
2. **Get the vault and asset token:** Connects to the vault contract and retrieves the underlying asset token.
3. **Get asset info:** Fetches the asset token's symbol and decimals.
4. **Calculate the deposit amount:** Converts the desired amount into the correct units based on decimals.
5. **Log deposit info:** Displays the deposit details, including sender, vault, and amount.
6. **Validate the deposit:** Checks if the amount exceeds the maximum allowed.
7. **Approve tokens for transfer:** Approves the vault to spend the deposit amount.
8. **Execute the deposit:** Calls `deposit()` to transfer assets and mint shares.

## Running the Script

To run the Firelight vault deposit script:

1. Ensure you have the [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) set up.
2. Update the `FIRELIGHT_VAULT_ADDRESS` constant with the correct vault address for your network.
3. Adjust the `DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` constant to the desired number of tokens.
4. Ensure your account has sufficient asset balance (e.g., FXRP) to cover the deposit.
5. Run the script using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/firelight/deposit.ts --network coston2
```

## Output

The script outputs the following information:

```bash

```

## Difference Between Deposit and Mint

The Firelight vault provides two ways to add assets:

- **`deposit`**: You specify the amount of assets to deposit, and the vault calculates how many shares you'll receive based on the current exchange rate.
- **`mint`**: You specify the number of shares you want, and the vault calculates how many assets you need to deposit.

Both functions follow the [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) standard and result in the same outcome: you deposit assets and receive vault shares.

## Summary

In this guide, you learned how to deposit assets into a Firelight vault by specifying the amount of assets to deposit.
