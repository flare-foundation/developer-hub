## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to retrieve information about a Firelight vault, including vault metrics, period configuration, user balances, and withdrawal information.

The Firelight vault is an [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) vault architecture compatible with [FAssets](/fassets/overview).

## Prerequisites

- [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit)
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts)
- Understanding of [FAssets](/fassets/overview)

## Firelight Vaults Status Script

The following script retrieves and displays information about the Firelight vault:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/firelight/status.ts">
  {FirelightStatus}
</CodeBlock>

## Script Breakdown

The `main()` function executes the following steps:

1. **Get the account and vault instance:** Retrieves the signer account and connects to the Firelight vault contract.
2. **Get vault information:** Fetches vault data, including asset address, total assets, total supply, and period configuration.
3. **Get asset token information:** Retrieves the asset token's symbol and decimals for formatting.
4. **Log asset information:** Displays the asset address, symbol, and decimals.
5. **Log vault balances and exchange rate:** Shows total assets, total supply, and the current exchange rate.
6. **Log period configuration:** Displays period timing and configuration. Firelight vaults operate on [period-based logic](https://docs.firelight.finance/technical-documents#period-based-logic).
7. **Get and log user information:** Shows user balances and maximum limits for deposit, mint, withdraw, and redeem.
8. **Log user withdrawals:** Displays pending withdrawals for current and previous periods.

## Running the Script

To run the Firelight vault status script:

1. Ensure you have the [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) set up.
2. Update the `FIRELIGHT_VAULT_ADDRESS` constant with the correct vault address for your network.
3. Run the script using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/firelight/status.ts --network coston2
```

## Output

The script outputs the following information:
