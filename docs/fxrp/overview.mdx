FXRP is the [FAsset](/fassets/overview) representation of XRP on the Flare network.
It is an [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token that represents XRP bridged from the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to Flare.

FXRP is powered by the [FAssets](/fassets/overview) system, a trustless, over-collateralized bridge infrastructure that enables the creation of wrapped tokens for assets from non-smart contract networks.

### Key Features

- **ERC-20 Standard:** As an [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token, FXRP is compatible with all EVM-compatible wallets, smart contracts, and DeFi protocols on Flare, giving you full interoperability across the ecosystem.
- **Trustless Bridge:** Your FXRP is backed by the [FAssets](/fassets/overview) system, which uses the [Flare Data Connector (FDC)](/fdc/overview) to verify XRPL transactions, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries.
- **Always Redeemable:** You can redeem your FXRP for the original XRP at any time, maintaining complete control over your assets.
- **DeFi Integration:** Use your FXRP in various DeFi applications, including lending, borrowing, yield farming, and liquidity provision across Flare's ecosystem.
- **Yield Opportunities:** Earn yield on your FXRP through protocols like [Firelight](/fxrp/firelight/status), which provides [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) compliant vaults for FXRP holders.

## How to Acquire FXRP

There are four primary ways to acquire FXRP:

### Testnet Faucet

On **Flare Testnet Coston2**, you can testnet FXRP directly from the [Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2) — no minting required. This is the fastest way to start testing FAssets integrations.

### Using Minting dApp

The most direct way to acquire FXRP is by minting it from native XRP on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) using a minting dApp.

You can mint FXRP on either of the following dApps:

- [https://fasset.oracle-daemon.com/flare](https://fasset.oracle-daemon.com/flare)
- [https://fassets.au.cc](https://fassets.au.cc)

### Mint FXRP via Code

You can also mint FXRP programmatically using smart contracts and code.

This approach is ideal for developers who want to integrate FXRP minting into their applications or automate the process for their users.

For complete code examples and step-by-step instructions, see the [FAssets minting guide](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-mint).

### Swap Other Tokens for FXRP

You can also acquire FXRP by swapping other tokens (such as USDT0, FLR, or other ERC-20 tokens) on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Flare.

For example, you can swap USDT0 to FXRP using SparkDEX (Uniswap V3) as described in the [swap guide](/fxrp/token-interactions/usdt0-fxrp-swap).

## Operational Parameters

Review the key [FXRP operational parameters](/fxrp/parameters), including minting caps, lot sizes, and redemption fees across all supported networks.

For the complete list of all FAssets parameters, see the [FAssets Operational Parameters](/fassets/operational-parameters) page.
