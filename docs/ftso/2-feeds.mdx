FTSOv2's block-latency feeds update incrementally with each new block on Flare, approximately every 1.8 seconds. Every feed leverages Flare's network of 100 independent data providers. These feeds primarily support cryptocurrency price data and are free to query on Flare, enabling decentralized applications to access up-to-date information without incurring additional costs.

Each block-latency feed is uniquely identified by an ID composed of three components in a structured encoding process:

1. **Category:** Indicates the type of asset - Crypto: `01`, Forex: `02`, Commodity: `03`, Stock: `04`

2. **Hex-Encoded Feed Name:** The name of the feed is converted to a hexadecimal format.

3. **Zero Padding:** The combined category and hex-encoded feed name are padded with zeros to a length of 21 bytes.

The resulting string is then prefixed with `0x`.

<summary>Example of the structured encoding process.</summary>

Taking the feed name `FLR/USD`:

- **Category**: `01` (Crypto)
- **Hex-Encoded Feed Name**: `464c522f555344` (hexadecimal representation of `FLR/USD`)
- **Zero Padding**: The category and hex-encoded feed name combined and padded: `01464c522f55534400000000000000000000000000`
- **Final ID**: Adding the `0x` prefix results in `0x01464c522f55534400000000000000000000000000`

:::warning

Feed IDs are not addresses. They are `bytes21` structured encodings that combine the category and feed name to ensure each feed has a unique identifier.

## Need more feeds?

Block-latency feeds are just one subset of the feeds available on Flare. If you need additional feeds beyond what is currently available, you can raise a [New Feed Request Issue](https://github.com/flare-foundation/developer-hub/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

When a feed request is submitted, it is reviewed by the FTSO Management Group, which is comprised of the FTSO data providers as outlined in [FIP.08](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_8.html#222-through-the-ftso-management-group).
