FTSOv2's block-latency feeds update incrementally with each new block on Flare, approximately every 1.8 seconds. Every feed leverages Flare's network of 100 independent data providers. These feeds primarily support cryptocurrency price data and are free to query on Flare, enabling decentralized applications to access up-to-date information without incurring additional costs.

Each block-latency feed is uniquely identified by an ID composed of three components in a structured encoding process:

1. **Category:** Indicates the type of asset - Crypto: `01`, Forex: `02`, Commodity: `03`, Stock: `04`, Custom Feeds: `05`

2. **Hex-Encoded Feed Name:** The name of the feed is converted to a hexadecimal format.

3. **Zero Padding:** The combined category and hex-encoded feed name are padded with zeros to a length of 21 bytes.

The resulting string is then prefixed with `0x`.

<FeedExplanation />

:::warning

- Feed IDs are **not** addresses. They are `bytes21` structured encodings that combine the category and feed name to ensure each feed has a unique identifier.
- **Do not** hardcode the number of decimals for a feed in your smart contract, as these can change as the feed value changes. You can use either of the following solutions:
  - Check the number of decimal places every query using [`getFeedById`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface#getfeedbyid).
  - Use the feed value in Wei using [`getFeedByIdInWei`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface#getfeedbyidinwei).

## Custom Feeds

:::warning

Custom Feeds, introduced in [FIP.13](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_13.html), have a distinct risk profile compared to standard FTSO feeds. Unlike standard FTSO feeds, the security of a Custom Feed is conditional on the logic defined in its smart contract.

## Need more feeds?

FTSOv2 can scale up to 1000 feeds. If you need additional FTSOv2 feeds beyond what is currently available, you can raise a New Feed Request Issue on GitHub. When a feed request is submitted, it is reviewed by the FTSO Management Group, which is comprised of the FTSO data providers as outlined in [FIP.08](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_8.html#222-through-the-ftso-management-group).
