FTSOv2's block-latency feeds update incrementally with each new block on Flare, approximately every 1.8 seconds. Every feed leverages Flare's network of 100 independent data providers. These feeds primarily support cryptocurrency price data and are free to query on Flare, enabling decentralized applications to access up-to-date information without incurring additional costs.

Each block-latency feed is uniquely identified by an ID composed of three components in a structured encoding process:

1. **Category:** Indicates the type of asset - Crypto: `01`, Forex: `02`, Commodity: `03`, Stock: `04`, Custom Feeds: `05`

2. **Hex-Encoded Feed Name:** The name of the feed is converted to a hexadecimal format.

3. **Zero Padding:** The combined category and hex-encoded feed name are padded with zeros to a length of 21 bytes.

The resulting string is then prefixed with `0x`.

<FeedExplanation />

:::warning

- Feed IDs are **not** addresses. They are `bytes21` structured encodings that combine the category and feed name to ensure each feed has a unique identifier.
- **Do not** hardcode the number of decimals for a feed in your smart contract, as these can change as the feed value changes. You can use either of the following solutions:
  - Check the number of decimal places every query using [`getFeedById`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface#getfeedbyid).
  - Use the feed value in Wei using [`getFeedByIdInWei`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface#getfeedbyidinwei).

## Custom Feeds

:::warning[Risk Profile]

Each Custom Feed has a unique risk profile determined by its smart contract and data source, which users and developers must assess individually.

:::

Custom Feeds, introduced in [FIP.13](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_13.html), extend the FTSO by enabling developers to create onchain feeds for arbitrary time-series data.
Unlike standard FTSO feeds, which are secured by a decentralized network of data providers, Custom Feeds derive their values from logic defined in a developer-controlled smart contract.
This expands the FTSO's capabilities beyond traditional price pairs, allowing for a wider variety of data to be brought onto the Flare network, such as prices for Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs), data from specific offchain APIs, or other bespoke datasets.

## Need more feeds?

FTSOv2 can scale up to 1000 feeds. If you need additional FTSOv2 feeds beyond what is currently available, you can raise a New Feed Request Issue on GitHub. When a feed request is submitted, it is reviewed by the FTSO Management Group, which is comprised of the FTSO data providers as outlined in [FIP.08](https://proposals.flare.network/FIP/FIP_8.html#222-through-the-ftso-management-group).
