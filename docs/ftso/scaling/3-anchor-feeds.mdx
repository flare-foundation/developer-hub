Scaling's anchor feeds update every 90 seconds with each new voting epoch on Flare. These feeds, accessible offchain, support various asset classes including equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

Each anchor feed is uniquely identified by an ID composed of three components in a structured encoding process:

1. **Category:** Indicates the type of asset:
   - Crypto: `01`
   - Forex: `02`
   - Commodity: `03`
   - Stock: `04`

2. **Hex-Encoded Feed Name:** The name of the feed is converted to a hexadecimal format.

3. **Zero Padding:** The combined category and hex-encoded feed name are padded with zeros to a length of 21 bytes.

The resulting string is then prefixed with `0x`.

:::warning

Feed IDs are not addresses. They are `bytes21` structured encodings that combine the category and feed name to ensure each feed has a unique identifier.
