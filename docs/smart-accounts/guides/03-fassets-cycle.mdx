In this guide, we will walk you through all aspects of the [FAssets](/fassets/overview) process.
We will start with an account on XRPL, we will send its assets to Flare, and then return them to XRPL.
The steps we will take will be as follows:

1. `mint`: convert XRP to FXRP
2. `deposit`: deposit FXRP to the Firelight vault
3. `withdraw`: withdraw FXRP from the Firelight vault
4. `redeem`: convert FXRP back to XRP

We will do all of that through the [Flare Smart Accounts CLI](/smart-accounts/guides/fsa-cli).
The CLI allows us to make XRPL transactions through terminal commands.

:::note
The idea behind the Flare Smart Accounts is that we perform actions on the Flare chain through instructions sent on XRPL.

## Mint

First, we mint FXRP by reserving the necessary collateral and then sending XRP to the agent's underlying address.
We will mint `1` lot of FXRP, with the agent at the address `0x55c815260cBE6c45Fe5bFe5FF32E3C7D746f14dC`.
The CLI command that does this is:

```sh
 ./smart_accounts.py bridge mint -a 0x55c815260cBE6c45Fe5bFe5FF32E3C7D746f14dC -l 1
```

The CLI sends both the `reserveCollateral` instruction and the `Payment` transaction to the agent's underlying address.

## Deposit

Next, we deposit `1` FXRP into the Firelight vault, specified by the `MasterAccountController` contract.
Here, the CLI sends the `deposit` instruction.
The command is:

```sh
./smart_accounts.py bridge deposit -a 1
```

## Withdraw

We withdraw the same number of tokens that we have just deposited from the Firelight vault.
The process involves two steps.
The CLI first sends the `withdraw` instruction, and afterwards, the `claimWithdraw`.
The first instruction starts the withdrawal process, and the second claims the FXRP once it is released.

We use the command:

```sh
./smart_accounts.py bridge withdraw -a 1
```

## Redeem

The last step is to convert FXRP back to XRP.
We will redeem the `1` lot of FXRP we minted in the first step back to XRP.
We will invoke the CLI with the following command.

```sh
./smart_accounts.py bridge redeem -a 1
```

## Simulation

The above cycle can be simulated with a single CLI command:

```sh
 ./smart_accounts.py debug simulation -a 0x55c815260cBE6c45Fe5bFe5FF32E3C7D746f14dC -m 1 -d 1
```
