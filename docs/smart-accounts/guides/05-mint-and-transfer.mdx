In this guide we will take a look at how we can use the [Flare smart accounts CLI](/smart-accounts/guides/fsa-cli) to perform a mint action, followed by the transfer of freshly minted FXRP.
What this allows us to do is to, effectively, **mint FXRP onto someone else's Flare address**.
This guide is aimed primarily at Web3 developers who desire to engage with the FAssets system but want to sidestep the base minting process.

Let us suppose that we want to mint `1` lot of FXRP, and transfer it to the address `0xf5488132432118596fa13800b68df4c0ff25131d`.
First, we need to prepare a collateral reservation instruction.
We do that with the following CLI command.

```sh
./smart_accounts.py encode fxrp-cr --wallet-id 0 --value 1 --agent-vault-id 1
```

The `--wallet-id` flag expects a Flare-designated parameter, intended for wallet identification by the operator.
It has no impact on the result of the action performed.
Because no number has been provided to us, we set it to `0`.
We chose the agent vault with ID `1` from the list of available agents.
{/* TODO:(Nik) Link to the guide about getting agent vault addresses. */}

```sh
0x0000000000000000000000010001000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

</details>

Then, we need to actually send the instruction as an XRPL Payment transaction to the operator's XRPL address.
We pipe the output of the first command into a `bridge` command.

But that is not, by itself, sufficient.
To complete the minting step, we need to also transfer `1` lot worth of FXRP to the agent's vault we specified.
We do that by piping the output of the second command - the hash of the transaction that carried our collateral reservation instruction - into the second `bridge` command, with the `mint-tx` positional argument.

```sh
./smart_accounts.py encode fxrp-cr --wallet-id 0 --value 1 --agent-vault-id 1 \
  | ./smart_accounts.py bridge instruction - \
  | ./smart_accounts.py bridge mint-tx --wait -
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

```sh
sent bridge instruction transaction: 08C2DD9EF3C0BB0A29D70F7E495EB3D96E1AA443B9100052FCCB44A176A9FBB8
sent mint tx: CD15241A6F0D2AFE5441C4FE3A2A9360109164CDCDC9EF3BC6A652D3C257DEA2
CD15241A6F0D2AFE5441C4FE3A2A9360109164CDCDC9EF3BC6A652D3C257DEA2
```

</details>

Next, we prepare the transfer instruction.
We will send `10` FXRP (which equals `1` lot) to the address `0xf5488132432118596fa13800b68df4c0ff25131d`.
The encode CLI command that does this is:

```sh
./smart_accounts.py encode fxrp-transfer \
  --wallet-id 0 \
   --value 10 \
  --recipient-address "0xf5488132432118596fa13800b68df4c0ff25131d"
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

```sh
0x01000000000000000000000af5488132432118596fa13800b68df4c0ff25131d
```

</details>

Lastly, we send the instruction as an XRPL Payment transaction to the operator's XRPL address.
We do this, again, by piping the output of the above `encode` command into a `bridge` command.

```sh
./smart_accounts.py encode fxrp-transfer \
  --wallet-id 0 \
   --value 10 \
  --recipient-address "0xf5488132432118596fa13800b68df4c0ff25131d" \
  | ./smart_accounts.py bridge instruction -
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

```sh
sent bridge instruction transaction: 9D5420C689DE7E0189BA15C4F874E491E4A08610A792472DF421B501DD5088AD
9D5420C689DE7E0189BA15C4F874E491E4A08610A792472DF421B501DD5088AD
```

</details>

With that, we have successfully minted `1` lot of FXRP, and transferred it to the Flare address `0xf5488132432118596fa13800b68df4c0ff25131d`.
