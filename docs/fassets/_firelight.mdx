[Firelight](https://firelight.finance) is a yield-generating protocol built on top of FXRP.
It provides [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) compliant vault that allows users to deposit FXRP and earn yield through the [FAssets](/fassets/overview) system.

Firelight vault operates on a [period-based logic](https://docs.firelight.finance/technical-documents#period-based-logic), where deposits and withdrawals are processed at specific intervals.
Users receive vault shares representing their proportional ownership of the vault's assets.
