FAssets is currently in open beta on Songbird Testnet Coston.

Get involved in testing by following the [FAssets Guides](/category/fassets-guides).

:::

FAssets is enabled by Flare's data enshrined data protocols, the [Flare Data Connector](/fdc/overview) and [Flare Time Series Oracle](/ftso/overview). The FTSO provides decentralised price feeds for all the tokens involved, and the Data Connector can verify that a required action has taken place on a different chain.

Each FAsset will be backed by mixed on-chain collateral held by an agent and in a community provided pool. This backing consists of three asset types: the underlying, stablecoin or ETH collateral, and Flare native token collateral, FLR or SGB. The minting and redeeming process will be supported by a number of agents. Their role in the system is secured through over-collateralization, such that the system is rendered trustless.

Someone who wishes to mint FAssets starts by selecting an agent and paying a small fee to reserve the required collateral. The minter then sends the agent the underlying asset, with the Data Connector used to prove the transaction has taken place on the other chain. Once the payment has been verified, the FAssets are minted as ERC-20 tokens on Flare. These tokens can be used within DeFi on Flare or bridged to another chain.
