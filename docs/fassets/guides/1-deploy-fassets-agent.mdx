The FAssets system by Flare enables non-smart contract tokens like BTC and XRP to interact trustlessly with smart contracts on the Flare network, unlocking their use in DeFi applications. It achieves this through collateralized minting, utilizing [Flare Data Connector (FDC)](/fdc/overview) and [Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO)](/ftso/overview) for secure cross-chain functionality.

Agents in the FAssets system facilitate the minting and redemption of FAssets by providing over-collateralized assets and managing transactions securely. A liquidator in the FAssets system monitors agent's collateralization levels to ensure the system's security and trustlessness.

In this guide, you will learn the preferred methods for setting up and managing the FAssets agents using the frontend interface and running the liquidator bot.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

The server should have a minimum of 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM and be built on AMD64 architecture running a Linux operating system.
It also requires at least 40 GB of disk space to accommodate the FAssets agent and its dependencies

Recommended Providers: Linode, DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP.

### Software

Ensure you have installed Docker version 25.0.4 or higher and Docker Compose version v2.24.7 or higher.
Setting up and running the FAssets agent is accomplished by using Docker containers, so knowledge of Docker is essential.
Using Docker eliminates the need to manage tool versions and their compatibilities.

### Financials

To participate, ensure you meet the following minimum deposit requirements:

- **Songbird Tokens (SGB):** Deposit a minimum of 1,000 SGB into the `owner.native.address` specified in the `secrets.json` file.

- **USDX Tokens:** Agents must deposit a USDX as vault collateral tokens into the `owner.native.address`.

- **XRP Tokens:** For XRP agents, you need to deposit 500 XRP Ledger native tokens (XRP) into the `owner.XRP.address`.

- **Bitcoin (BTC):** Bitcoin agents should hold at least 0.005 BTC to cover potential high transaction fees in the `owner.BTC.address`.

- **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Doge agents should maintain a minimum balance of 100 DOGE to cover potential high transaction fees in the `owner.DOGE.address`.

Additionally, please ensure there is sufficient collateral for vault and pool requirements at the `owner.native.address`.

### Contract Addresses

See the [FAssets Reference](/fassets/reference) for important FAssets smart contract addresses representing tokens and notable system components, provided for your convenience during the Open Beta on the Songbird network.

## Setting Up

Follow these steps to set up the FAssets agent using Docker:

1. Clone the repository in your Linux server:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots-deploy
   cd fasset-bots-deploy
   ```

2. Set up the environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

3. Set up the configuration file:

   ```bash
   ./populate_config.sh
   ```

4. Login into GitHub Container Registry:

   ```bash
   docker login ghcr.io
   ```

5. Get the latest docker containers from the registry:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

### Setting Environment Variables

To begin using the FAssets Docker infrastructure, you must configure the settings in the `.env` environment file.

- Make sure to set the machine address in the `.env` file using the `MACHINE_ADDRESS` variable.
- Set the database password `FASSET_DB_PASSWORD`.

:::warning
Once the database is created, the password will not change if you modify it in the `.env` file.
:::

#### Optional Settings

You can configure several optional settings in the `.env` environment file.

## Setting up Secret Keys

The FAsset agents require multiple keys for the Flare and underlying network chains, which must be generated to make the agent operational.

1. Create a new management wallet or use an existing one, preferably a cold wallet, as the management address for your agent.
2. Generate the secrets using this command by replacing the `MANAGEMENT_WALLET_ADDRESS` with your management wallet address:

   ```bash
   ./generate_secrets.sh MANAGEMENT_WALLET_ADDRESS
   ```

3. Copy the `secrets.new.json` to `secrets.json`:

   ```bash
   cp secrets.new.json secrets.json
   ```

4. Allow the user to read and write `secrets.json`:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 secrets.json
   ```

5. Set file ownership to user ID 1000, the default Linux user ID, for proper permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo chown 1000:1000 secrets.json
   ```

6. Make a backup of the `secrets.json` file and store it securely.

## Setting the File Permissions

Set the file permissions for the `log` directory:

```bash
sudo chown 1000:1000 log -R
```

## Whitelist the Management Address

:::info
Given our current insurance mechanisms to protect users, Flare Labs will not add any more agents to the FAssets protocol on Songbird.
As covered in this [blog](https://flare.network/fxrp-is-live-on-songbird/), Flare Labs will cover losses up to \$100,000 per asset, for a total coverage of $300,000.
We appreciate the interest received and look forward to onboarding agents once we have launched FAssets on Flare mainnet.
:::

To access the FAssets system, you must be whitelisted for security reasons.

1. Use the [FlareFAssetsSongbirdBot Telegram channel](https://t.me/FlareFAssetsSongbirdBot), specifically designed for registration, and provide the necessary information.
2. Enter the information and confirm, and the Telegram bot will inform you about the successful process.
3. You need to wait for the Flare team to approve registrations.
4. If the information you entered is correct, the Telegram Bot will notify you that you have been whitelisted for the FAssets Songbird.

### Check Whitelist Status

Checking if your agent's management address has been whitelisted is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate with the block explorer to the [`AgentOwnerRegistry`](/fassets/reference#deployed-contracts) contract and open the Read Contract tab.
2. Connect your wallet with any address to the block explorer so you can gain access to read functions from the smart contract.
3. Execute the `isWhitelisted` function with the value of the management address. This function returns `bool`: `true` for whitelisted or `false` for not whitelisted.

## Set the Work Address

After you have completed with the whitelisting process, you need to set the work address for your agent.
Configuring the native address links your agent's work address to the management address and grants access.

1. Navigate with the block explorer to the [`AgentOwnerRegistry`](/fassets/reference#deployed-contracts) contract and open the Write Contract tab.
2. Connect the management address wallet you used to generate the access keys above.
3. Register the work address by executing the `setWorkAddress` function with the value of `owner.native.address` from the `secrets.json` file.

## Configure the RPCs

In order to connect to various blockchains, you need to configure the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) configurations.

You can obtain the `xrp_rpc` for the XRP Ledger, `btc_rpc` for Bitcoin, and `doge_rpc` for Dogecoin from the Flare team, configured in the `secrets.json` file under the `apiKey` key.

## Configure the Server

To access the FAssets admin interface, configure the server to route requests to both the frontend and backend.
Allow requests on the default port of `4000` for the backend and `3000` for the frontend.

:::warning

When configuring the server for FAssets, ensure all **security measures** are implemented to safeguard your system. Exposing the FAssets backend can lead to severe vulnerabilities.

- **Never expose the FAssets agent interface (`/fasset-backend`) to the public network**.
- As a rule of thumb, restrict access to the backend **only** within the local network.
- Use firewalls and IP-based access controls to allow requests **only** from trusted IP addresses.
- Consider enabling IP whitelisting for specific addresses to restrict access.

## Start the FAssets Agent

Start the FAssets agent using the Docker infrastructure by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Execute FAsset Bot Commands

To run commands for the FAsset bot, please use the `cli` profile.

Use the specific Docker container:

- the `agent-bot` for the FAsset agent bot;
- the `user-bot` for the FAsset user bot.

### Execute Agent Bot Commands

To execute agent bot commands, use the `cli` profile with the `agent-bot` Docker container.
For example, to get the FAssets system running agents, use this command:

```bash
docker compose --profile cli run agent-bot listAgents --fasset FASSET
```

Full reference for the agent bot commands can be found in the [Agent Bot CLI Reference](/fassets/reference/agent-bot).

### Execute User Bot Commands

To execute user bot commands, use the `cli` profile and the `user-bot` Docker container.
For example, to retrieve FAsset system info, use this command:

```bash
docker compose --profile cli run user-bot info --fasset FASSET
```
