### How to set up FAssets agent?

Refer to the [FAssets Agent Setup Guide](/fassets/guides/deploy-fassets-agent).

### What are the FAssets agent icon file requirements?

A link to your FAssets agent icon should end with `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, etc., and **must not** be the same as the example provided by the bot.

### Can an agent's logo, description, or name be changed after approval?

No, it is not.

### Can I register a new management address if one is already whitelisted in my Telegram account?

No, you would need a new Telegram account.

### What is a management address?

It is an EVM address you control. Ensure your seed phrase remains secure.

### What is an owner's address, and is it different from a work address?

Work and owner addresses are the same and are referred to as `owner.native.address` in your `secrets.json` file. This address provides collateral for your vault and pool.

### How can I change the agent's fees?

Use the command:

```bash
updateAgentSetting <agentVaultAddress> <agentSettingName> <agentSettingValue>
```

Alternatively, update your `tmp.agent-settings.json` file.

### Do I need my agent running all the time?

Yes, for an agent to stay operational, it must run continuously.

### What should I do if my agent database is corrupted, lost, or deleted?

Do not restart the agent, as this may result in double payments.
The current solution is duplicating the database and launching a new agent instance.
You should monitor your database closely and, if access is lost, remove the agent from the available list, self-close FAssets, and backup agent keys.

### Is there a minimum history needed in the Data Availability Layer for agents?

No minimum history is required; it can be set to the latest block.
You need to start the [Data Availability Layer](/fdc/overview#data-availability-layer) before you can participate as an FAsset agent.
