The agent bot can send notifications to a Telegram bot or API endpoint.
It helps monitor the health of the agent and the network.

## Agent Bot Notifications Configuration

1. Add the following configuration to the `apiNotifierConfigs` list in the `config.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "apiUrl": "NOTIFICATIONS_API_URL",
     "apiKey": "API_KEY",
     "level": "danger"
   }
   ```

   If the level field is omitted inside configuration, the bot will default it to `danger`.

2. The `apiUrl` field specifies the URL to send the notifications to.
   The bot will send the notifications as POST requests to the `/api/agent/botAlert` endpoint.

3. The `apiKey` is sent in the header under `x-apikey`.
   The `level` field specifies the minimum level of alerts to send.
   If the `level` field is omitted, the bot will default it to `danger`.

4. The agent bot can send notifications as POST requests to the endpoint `apiUrl/api/agent/botAlert` with the following body:

   ```typescript
   PostAlert = {
     bot_type: string,
     address: string,
     level: string,
     title: string,
     description: string,
   };
   ```

## Flare Hosted Telegram Notifications Alert Configuration

1. Get the API key from the [FAssets Telegram Bot](http://t.me/FlareFAssetsSongbirdBot) by sending `/events` and selecting `Subscribe to Events`.
2. Add the following configuration to the `apiNotifierConfigs` list in the `config.json` file, replacing `API_KEY` with the key obtained from the bot.

   ```json
   {
     "apiUrl": "https://fasset-tg-bot-songbird.flare.network",
     "apiKey": "API_KEY",
     "level": "danger"
   }
   ```

   Notifications will only be sent out for `danger` and `critical` levels, regardless of the configured level.
   This is enforced by the Telegram bot, which delivers priority messages due to heavy load.
