Liquidators are a critical component of the FAssets system, overseeing agents and ensuring their self-sufficiency. They contribute to the overall stability and efficiency of the system by executing liquidations.

Liquidators initiate a process where FAssets are sent into the system in exchange for collateral plus a premium. This involves burning the FAssets, which reduces the agent's collateral requirement and allows liquidators to earn rewards. Anyone can become a liquidator, supporting the FAssets system while earning rewards.

This guide explains how to run an FAssets bot that monitors the FAssets system and responds to its state. The bot must be running continuously and be constantly online to avoid missing liquidation opportunities and earning rewards.

## Prerequisites

**Minimum hardware requirements:**

- CPU: 2 cores
- RAM: 4 GB
- Disk: 50 GB SSD

**Tooling:**

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

:::note

If you are using Windows, it is strongly recommended to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL v2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

## Setup

:::info

If you set up an FAssets agent, bot or user, please use a separate directory for each role.

:::

1. Clone the [fasset-bots](https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots) repository and switch to the `open_beta` branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots.git
   cd fasset-bots
   git checkout open_beta
   ```

2. Install the dependencies and build the project:

   ```bash
   yarn && yarn build
   ```

3. Copy the environment file from `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Configure the Access Keys

The FAsset liquidators operate with an address for the Flare network chain. You must generate these keys to set up the liquidator.

1.  Create or use an existing management (cold) wallet that will be your agent's management address. Fund this wallet with some CFLR for gas using the [Coston Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston).

2.  Generate secrets using the following command, replace `MANAGEMENT_WALLET_ADDRESS` with your wallet address:

    ```bash
    yarn key-gen generateSecrets --other MANAGEMENT_WALLET_ADDRESS --other -o secrets.json
    ```

    :::info

    This command can only be executed once, after which all secret keys will be generated. You must use a separate directory for each role you want to perform: agent, bot, or minter and redeemer.

    :::

    :::warning

    The addresses in `secrets.json` are designed to be used as hot wallets and should not hold large amounts of tokens, since their private keys are accessible on a machine that is permanently online. Instead, it's best to keep your main account in an offline wallet and transfer funds to these hot wallets as needed.

    :::

3.  Prevent other users from reading the `secrets.json` file:

    ```bash
    chmod 600 secrets.json
    ```

4.  The `native_rpc` is the API key used to connect to a public node on the Coston blockchain network.
    This key is necessary for authenticating and enabling secure communication between your application and the blockchain network.
    To configure your connection, you must fill the `native_rpc` field in the `secrets.json` file with the API key provided by the Flare team during the FAssets testing period.
    Use this value in the `secrets.json` file:

    ```json
    "native_rpc": "AavSehMLhcgz3crQHH5YJ3Rt8GMQGdV9aViGilADXGnTcjij",
    ```

5.  The `secrets.json` file contains the `liquidator.address` and `liquidator.private_key` fields, representing the Flare account responsible for running the liquidator and covering gas fees for the smart contract calls. Ensure this address has enough tokens to cover gas fees by transferring some CFLR to it. You can obtain CFLR tokens from the [Coston Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/).

6.  The `liquidator` account must hold enough FAssets to execute liquidation tasks and cover the liquidated agent FAssets amount.
    Therefore, you must mint FAssets and move them to the `liquidator` account.

## Run the Liquidator

The liquidator observes the FAssets system and reacts to its state.
To run the liquidator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
yarn run-liquidator
```

When you want to stop the server, press Ctrl + C.

### Maximize liquidator uptime

1. Download the example [`liquidator-bot.service`](https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots/blob/main/docs/systemd/liquidator-bot.service) from the repository.

2. Modify the following variables in `liquidator-bot.service`:

   - **WorkingDirectory**: Set this to your `fasset-bots` checkout directory.
   - **User**, **Group**: Set these to the user under which the service should run.
   - **ExecStart**: If required, change the path to `node`.

3. Copy the modified service file to `systemd` directory:

   ```bash
   sudo cp liquidator-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```

4. Reload the `systemd` daemon to recognize the new service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

5. **Manage the service:**

   To start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start liquidator-bot
   ```

   To stop the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop liquidator-bot
   ```

6. Enable auto-start on boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable liquidator-bot
   ```

7. **View service logs:**

   Follow the console output live:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -fu liquidator-bot.service
   ```

   View past logs in `less`:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -eu liquidator-bot.service
   ```

:::tip

- Always verify the paths and user permissions when setting up the service to avoid common issues.
- Use `sudo systemctl status liquidator-bot` to check the status and troubleshoot any problems with the service.
