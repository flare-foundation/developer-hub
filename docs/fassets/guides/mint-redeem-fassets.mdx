[FAssets](/fassets/overview) allows non smart contract tokens to be used with smart contracts on Flare. This guide details how to:

- **Mint:** Convert testnet XRP (on XRPL Testnet) → FTestXRP (on Songbird Testnet Coston).
- **Redeem:** Convert FTestXRP (on Songbird Testnet Coston) → testnet XRP (on XRPL Testnet).

## Prerequisites

**Tooling:**

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

:::note

If you are using Windows, it is strongly recommended to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL v2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

:::

## Setup

### Install repository

1. Clone the [fasset-bots](https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots) repository and switch to the `open_beta` branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots.git
   cd fasset-bots
   git checkout open_beta
   ```

2. Install the dependencies and build the project:

   ```bash
   yarn && yarn build
   ```

3. Copy the environment file from `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Configure Access Keys

The FAsset user operates with multiple keys for the Flare and underlying network chains.

1.  Generate the user's secrets:

    ```bash
    yarn key-gen generateSecrets --user -o secrets.json
    ```

    Among other things, this command creates wallets on the XRP Ledger and Flare networks that you will use throughout the rest of this guide.

    :::info

    This command can only be executed once, after which all secret keys will be generated. You must use a separate directory for each role you want to perform: agent, bot, or minter and redeemer.

    :::

    :::warning

    The addresses in `secrets.json` are designed to be used as hot wallets and should not hold large amounts of tokens, since their private keys are accessible on a machine that is permanently online. Instead, it's best to keep your main account in an offline wallet and transfer funds to these hot wallets as needed.

    :::

2.  Fund the user's Songbird Testnet Coston wallet with some CFLR to pay for gas. The user wallet's address is in the `secrets.json` file under the `user.native.address` key.
    You can get CFLR tokens from the [Coston Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston).

3.  Prevent other users from reading `secrets.json`:

    ```bash
    chmod 600 secrets.json
    ```

4.  Fill the `native_rpc`, `xrp_rpc` and `indexer` fields in the `secrets.json` file with the following values, note that these values only apply to [Songbird Testnet Coston](/network/overview#configuration):

    ```json
    "native_rpc": "AavSehMLhcgz3crQHH5YJ3Rt8GMQGdV9aViGilADXGnTcjij",
    "xrp_rpc": "4tg3AxysaZodxTqsCtcMnBdBIEkR6KDKGTdqBEA8g9MKq4bH",
    "indexer": "123456",
    ```

## Minting FAssets

1.  Determine your FAssets lot size:

    ```bash
    yarn user-bot info -f FTestXRP
    ```

    Find the line in the command output that displays the lot size in this format:

    ```plaintext
    Lot size: 20 FTestXRP
    ```

2.  Find your generated XRP Ledger testnet wallet address in `user.testXRP.address` from the `secrets.json` file you created above, and fund it using either one of the faucets:

    - [Bithomp XRPL Testnet Faucet](https://test.bithomp.com/faucet/)
    - [Tequ XRPL Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.tequ.dev/)

    :::info

    The minimum amount of FAssets you can mint is one lot, determined by the previous command.
    Furthermore, agents charge a fee, and you should pay for a transaction on the XRP network.
    Once you have selected an agent and know its fee, request enough XRP from the faucet to pay for it, plus the transaction cost.

    :::

3.  Mint the FTestXRP FAssets either by:

    **Automatic agent selection:** Replace `LOTS` with the number of lots from the first command output.

    ```bash
    yarn user-bot mint LOTS --fasset FTestXRP --secrets secrets.json
    ```

    **OR**

    **Manual agent selection:** List out the FAssets agents along with their minting fees:

    ```bash
    yarn user-bot --fasset FTestXRP agents
    ```

    Replace `AGENT_ADDRESS` with an agent address from the list obtained before, and `LOTS` with the number of lots from the first command output.

    ```bash
    yarn user-bot mint -a AGENT_ADDRESS LOTS --fasset FTestXRP --secrets secrets.json
    ```

## Redeeming FAssets

Redeem the FTestXRP for the underlying asset obtained in the previous step by running the following command and replacing `LOTS` with the number of lots you want to redeem:

```bash
yarn user-bot redeem LOTS --fasset FTestXRP --secrets secrets.json
```

If the agent pays immediately, the redemption process takes about 5 minutes. However, if the agent delays, the redeemer must wait 500 XRPL Testnet blocks or 900 seconds, plus 5 minutes for a [Flare Data Connector](/fdc/overview) proof, to execute the redemption default.
