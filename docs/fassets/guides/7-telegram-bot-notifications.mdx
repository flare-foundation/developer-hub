1. Get the API key from the [FAssets Telegram Bot](http://t.me/FlareFAssetsSongbirdBot) by sending `/events` and selecting `Subscribe to Events`.
2. Add the following configuration to the `apiNotifierConfigs` list in the `config.json` file, replacing `API_KEY` with the key obtained from the bot.

   ```json
   {
     "apiKey": "API_KEY",
     "apiUrl": "https://fasset-tg-bot-songbird.flare.network",
     "level": "danger"
   }
   ```

:::info
Please note that notifications will only be sent out for **danger** and **critical** levels, regardless of the configured level. This is enforced by the Telegram bot, which ignores other events to prevent unnecessary HTTP requests.
