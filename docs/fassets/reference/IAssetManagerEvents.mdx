`IAssetManagerEvents` is an interface that defines the events emitted by the [`IAssetManager`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager) contract.

Sourced from `IAssetManagerEvents.sol` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/IAssetManagerEvents.sol).ƒÅ

## Event Categories

The events are organized into the following categories:

- **[Minting Events](#minting-events)** - Events related to the FAssets minting process.
- **[Redemption Events](#redemption-events)** - All events related to the FAssets redemption process, including requests, tickets, outcomes, and failures.

## Minting Events

Events related to the FAssets minting process, including collateral reservation, execution, and defaults.
