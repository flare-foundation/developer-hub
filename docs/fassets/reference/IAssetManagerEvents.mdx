`IAssetManagerEvents` is an interface that defines the events emitted by the [`IAssetManager`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager) contract.

Sourced from `IAssetManagerEvents.sol` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/IAssetManagerEvents.sol).

## Events

### `CollateralReserved`

Emitted when a minter has reserved collateral, paid the reservation fee, and is expected to pay the underlying funds. The agent's collateral is reserved at this point.

Parameters:

- `agentVault`: Address of the agent vault
- `minter`: Address of the minter
- `collateralReservationId`: ID of the collateral reservation
- `valueUBA`: Value in underlying base amount
- `feeUBA`: Fee in underlying base amount
- `firstUnderlyingBlock`: First block number on the underlying chain
- `lastUnderlyingBlock`: Last block number on the underlying chain
- `lastUnderlyingTimestamp`: Last timestamp on the underlying chain
- `paymentAddress`: Address for payment
- `paymentReference`: Reference for payment
- `executor`: Address of the executor
- `executorFeeNatWei`: Fee for the executor in NAT wei

```solidity
event CollateralReserved(
    address indexed agentVault,
    address indexed minter,
    uint256 indexed collateralReservationId,
    uint256 valueUBA,
    uint256 feeUBA,
    uint256 firstUnderlyingBlock,
    uint256 lastUnderlyingBlock,
    uint256 lastUnderlyingTimestamp,
    string paymentAddress,
    bytes32 paymentReference,
    address executor,
    uint256 executorFeeNatWei
);
```

### `CollateralReservationRejected`

Emitted when an agent rejects the collateral reservation request due to the minter's identity. The reserved collateral is released.

Parameters:

- `agentVault`: Address of the agent vault
- `minter`: Address of the minter
- `collateralReservationId`: ID of the collateral reservation

```solidity
event CollateralReservationRejected(
    address indexed agentVault,
    address indexed minter,
    uint256 indexed collateralReservationId
);
```

### `CollateralReservationCancelled`

Emitted when a minter cancels the collateral reservation request due to agent inactivity. The reserved collateral is released.

Parameters:

- `agentVault`: Address of the agent vault
- `minter`: Address of the minter
- `collateralReservationId`: ID of the collateral reservation

```solidity
event CollateralReservationCancelled(
    address indexed agentVault,
    address indexed minter,
    uint256 indexed collateralReservationId
);
```

### `MintingExecuted`

Emitted when a minter has successfully paid the underlying funds in time and received the FAssets. The agent's collateral is locked at this point.

Parameters:

- `agentVault`: Address of the agent vault
- `collateralReservationId`: ID of the collateral reservation
- `mintedAmountUBA`: Amount of FAssets minted in underlying base amount
- `agentFeeUBA`: Fee paid to the agent in underlying base amount
- `poolFeeUBA`: Fee paid to the pool in underlying base amount

```solidity
event MintingExecuted(
    address indexed agentVault,
    uint256 indexed collateralReservationId,
    uint256 mintedAmountUBA,
    uint256 agentFeeUBA,
    uint256 poolFeeUBA
);
```

### `MintingPaymentDefault`

Emitted when a minter fails to pay the underlying funds in time. The collateral reservation fee is paid to the agent and the reserved collateral is released.

Parameters:

- `agentVault`: Address of the agent vault
- `minter`: Address of the minter
- `collateralReservationId`: ID of the collateral reservation
- `reservedAmountUBA`: Amount that was reserved in underlying base amount

```solidity
event MintingPaymentDefault(
    address indexed agentVault,
    address indexed minter,
    uint256 indexed collateralReservationId,
    uint256 reservedAmountUBA
);
```

### `CollateralReservationDeleted`

Emitted when both the minter and agent fail to present any proof within the attestation time window, and the agent calls `unstickMinting` to release the reserved collateral.

Parameters:

- `agentVault`: Address of the agent vault
- `minter`: Address of the minter
- `collateralReservationId`: ID of the collateral reservation
- `reservedAmountUBA`: Amount that was reserved in underlying base amount

```solidity
event CollateralReservationDeleted(
    address indexed agentVault,
    address indexed minter,
    uint256 indexed collateralReservationId,
    uint256 reservedAmountUBA
);
```

### `RedemptionRequested`

An event is emitted when the redeemer starts the redemption process.

```solidity
event RedemptionRequested(
    address indexed agentVault,
    address indexed redeemer,
    uint256 indexed requestId,
    string paymentAddress,
    uint256 valueUBA,
    uint256 feeUBA,
    uint256 firstUnderlyingBlock,
    uint256 lastUnderlyingBlock,
    uint256 lastUnderlyingTimestamp,
    bytes32 paymentReference,
    address executor,
    uint256 executorFeeNatWei);
```

### `RedemptionTicketCreated`

Event emitted when a redemption ticket is created when a minting transaction is executed.

Parameters:

```solidity
event RedemptionTicketCreated(
    address indexed agentVault,
    uint256 indexed redemptionTicketId,
    uint256 ticketValueUBA);
```

### `RedemptionTicketUpdated`

Event emitted when a redemption ticket value is changed (partially redeemed).

Parameters:

- `agentVault`: The address of the agent vault that will redeem the FAssets.
- `redemptionTicketId`: The ID of the redemption ticket.
- `ticketValueUBA`: The value of the redemption ticket in underlying chain currency.

```solidity
event RedemptionTicketUpdated(
    address indexed agentVault,
    uint256 indexed redemptionTicketId,
    uint256 ticketValueUBA);
```

### `RedemptionPerformed`

The event is emitted when the agent provides proof of redemption payment, and the agent's collateral is released.

```solidity
event RedemptionPerformed(
    address indexed agentVault,
    address indexed redeemer,
    uint64 indexed requestId,
    bytes32 transactionHash,
    uint256 redemptionAmountUBA,
    int256 spentUnderlyingUBA);
```
