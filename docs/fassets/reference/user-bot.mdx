Command line reference for managing and interacting with FAssets user bot. It allows users to mint and redeem FAssets, manage collateral pools, and query system information.

Sourced from `user-bot.ts` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fasset-bots/blob/main/packages/fasset-bots-cli/src/cli/user-bot.ts).

## Setup

Before running user-bot, ensure it is properly set up using the [FAsset agent deploy](/fassets/guides/deploy-fassets-agent) with Docker and then learn [how to execute the command line commands](/fassets/guides/deploy-fassets-agent#execute-fasset-bot-commands).

## Usage

To run the user-bot command line interface, use the `yarn user-bot` command with the desired command and arguments and add the `--fasset` flag with the FAsset symbol.

```bash
yarn user-bot [command] <args> --fasset [fAssetSymbol]
```

To list all available commands:

```bash
yarn user-bot help
```

To execute a specific command using the [Docker container](/fassets/guides/deploy-fassets-agent#execute-fasset-bot-commands) change `yarn user-bot` with `docker compose --profile cli run user-bot`:

```bash
docker compose --profile cli run user-bot [command] <args> --fasset [fAssetSymbol]
```

## General Commands

## System Info

Display information about the FAssets system.

```bash
yarn user-bot info
```

### List Agents

List available FAssets agents.

```bash
yarn user-bot agents
```

### Agent Information

Display information about a specific FAssets agent by providing the agent vault address.

```bash
yarn user-bot agentInfo <agentVaultAddress>
```

### Minting

### Mint

Mint the specified number of FAsset lots, specifying the number of lots to mint.

```bash
yarn user-bot mint <numberOfLots>
```

When executing the `mint` command, the following custom flags can be specified:

- **`-a <agentVaultAddress>`**  
  Specifies the agent for minting. If omitted, the bot automatically selects the agent with the lowest fee and sufficient capacity.

- **`--executor <executorAddress>`** _(Optional)_  
  Specifies the executor's native address.

- **`--executorFee <executorFee>`** _(Optional)_  
  Specifies the executor's fee in NAT.

- **`--noWait`**  
   Reserves and pays for minting without waiting for proof.

### Mint Execute

The `mintExecute` function is essential for completing the minting process.
It handles the minting of FAssets, distributes fees, and unlocks collateral.

This function ensures the following:

- The minter receives their minted FAssets after payment is confirmed.
- Agents and collateral providers are compensated for their involvement.
- System stability is maintained by requiring proof of underlying payments.

Using this function need to specify the `requestId` of the minting request.

```bash
yarn user-bot mintExecute <requestId>
```

### Mint Status

The `mintStatus` function provides information about the current state of a minting request.
It helps to track the progress of the minting process.

```bash
yarn user-bot mintStatus
```

### Update Mintings

The `updateMintings` function updates the status of all open minting requests in the FAsset system.
It ensures that the system remains up-to-date by resolving minting requests based on their current state or conditions, such as time expiration or payment verification.

```bash
yarn user-bot updateMintings
```

## Redemption

### Redeem

The `redeem` function enables FAsset holders to burn their FAssets in exchange for the equivalent amount of the underlying asset.
This ensures that FAssets can be converted to their original value on the underlying blockchain.
To redeem, specify the number of FAsset lots you wish to exchange.

```bash
yarn user-bot redeem <numberOfLots>
```

When executing the `redeem` command, the following custom flags can be specified:

- **`--executor <executorAddress>`** _(Optional)_  
   Specifies the executor's native address.

- **`--executorFee <executorFee>`** _(Optional)_  
   Specifies the executor's fee in NAT.

### Redemption Default

The `redemptionDefault` function is invoked when an agent fails to fulfill their obligation to deliver the underlying asset during a redemption process.
This function ensures that the redeemer is compensated, system integrity is maintained, and the agent is penalized for failing to meet their commitment.

Specify the `requestId` of the redemption request.

```bash
yarn user-bot redemptionDefault <requestId>
```

Additionally the custom flag can be specified:

- **`--noWait`\***
  Does not wait for non-payment proof. don't wait for non-payment proof, but immediately exit with exitcode 10 if the proof isn't available

### Redemption Status

The `redemptionStatus` function provides information about the current state of a redemption request in the FAsset system. It lists all open redemptions and their statuses.

Status can be one of the following:

- `PENDING`
- `SUCCESS`
- `DEFAULT`
- `EXPIRED`

```bash
yarn user-bot redemptionStatus
```

Additionally, the custom flag can be specified:

- **`--request-id <requestId>`**  
  Specifies the request ID of the redemption.

### Update Redemptions

The `updateRedemptions` function updates the status of one or more open redemption requests. It ensures that these requests are processed efficiently and appropriately addresses any unresolved or overdue requests. This function is essential for automating the entire redemption lifecycle.

```bash
yarn user-bot updateRedemptions
```

## Collateral Pool Management

### List Collateral Pools

Lists all available collateral pools, including:

- Pool address
- Token symbol
- Token price (CFLR)
- Collateral (CFLR)
- Fees (FXRP)
- Collateral Ratio

```bash
yarn user-bot pools
```

### Pool Holdings

The 'poolHoldings' function provides detailed information about the pools that user has holdings, listing:

- Pool address
- Token symbol
- Pool tokens

```bash
yarn user-bot poolHoldings
```

### Enter Pool

The `enterPool` function allows users to deposit collateral into a specific collateral pool and become a participant by specifying the collateral pool ID and collateral amount.

```bash
yarn user-bot enterPool <poolId> <collateralAmount>
```

### Exit Pool

The `exitPool` function allows participants to withdraw their share of collateral from a collateral pool by burning their Collateral Pool Tokens (CPTs) and receiving collateral. Specify the pool ID and the amount of collateral to withdraw.

```bash
yarn user-bot exitPool <poolId> <amount|all>
```

## Balance Management

```bash
yarn user-bot balance
```

## Secrets Management

```bash
yarn user-bot generateSecrets --user
```
