Command line reference for interacting with FAssets `AssetManager` contract.

## Information

### `getSettings`

Returns the complete asset manager settings as the [`AssetManagerSettings`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/data/AssetManagerSettings.sol) struct.

You can find detailed explanations of each parameter in the [FAssets Operational Parameters](/fassets/operational-parameters/#asset-manager-operational-parameters) documentation.

```solidity
function getSettings()
    external view
    returns (AssetManagerSettings.Data memory);
```

#### `getAgentInfo`

Returns detailed information about an agent as the [`AgentInfo`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/data/AgentInfo.sol) struct.

Need to provide the agent vault address.

You can find detailed explanations of each agent parameter in the [FAssets Operational Parameters](/fassets/operational-parameters/#default-agent-settings) documentation.

```solidity
function getAgentInfo(address _agentVault)
    external view
    returns (AgentInfo.Info memory);
```

### `collateralReservationFee`

Returns the collateral reservation fee amount.

Parameters:

- `_lots`: The number of lots for which to reserve collateral

Returns:

- `_reservationFeeNATWei`: The amount of reservation fee in NAT wei

```solidity
function collateralReservationFee(
    uint256 _lots
) external view returns (uint256 _reservationFeeNATWei);
```

### `collateralReservationInfo`

Returns the data about the collateral reservation for an ongoing minting.
Note: once the minting is executed or defaulted, the collateral reservation is deleted and this method fails.

Parameters:

- `_collateralReservationId`: The collateral reservation ID, as used for executing or defaulting the minting

```solidity
function collateralReservationInfo(uint256 _collateralReservationId)
    external view
    returns (CollateralReservationInfo.Data memory);
```

### `fAsset`

Returns the FAsset token contract (ERC-20) that is managed by this asset manager instance.

Returns:

- `IERC20`: The address of the FAsset token contract

```solidity
function fAsset()
    external view
    returns (IERC20);
```

## Redemption Queue

### `redemptionQueue`

Returns the redemption queue in the form of an array of [`RedemptionTicketInfo`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/data/RedemptionTicketInfo.sol) structs.

Parameters:

- `_firstRedemptionTicketId`: the ticket id to start listing from; if `0`, starts from the beginning
- `_pageSize`: the maximum number of redemption tickets to return

Returns:

- `_queue`: the (part of) the redemption queue; maximum length is \_pageSize
- `_nextRedemptionTicketId`: works as a cursor - if the `_pageSize` is reached and there are more tickets, it is the first ticket id not returned; if the end is reached, it is 0

```solidity
function redemptionQueue(
    uint256 _firstRedemptionTicketId,
    uint256 _pageSize
) external view
    returns (RedemptionTicketInfo.Data[] memory _queue, uint256 _nextRedemptionTicketId);
```

### `agentRedemptionQueue`

Returns the redemption queue for specific agent in the form of an array of [`RedemptionTicketInfo`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/data/RedemptionTicketInfo.sol) structs.

Parameters:

- `_agentVault`: the agent vault address of the queried agent
- `_firstRedemptionTicketId`: the ticket id to start listing from; if `0`, starts from the beginning
- `_pageSize`: the maximum number of redemption tickets to return

Returns:

- `_queue`: the (part of) the redemption queue; maximum length is \_pageSize
- `_nextRedemptionTicketId`: works as a cursor - if the` _pageSize` is reached and there are more tickets, it is the first ticket id not returned; if the end is reached, it is 0

```solidity
function agentRedemptionQueue(
    address _agentVault,
    uint256 _firstRedemptionTicketId,
    uint256 _pageSize
) external view
    returns (RedemptionTicketInfo.Data[] memory _queue, uint256 _nextRedemptionTicketId);
```

## Collateral Reservation

### `reserveCollateral`

Reserves collateral for minting FAssets.
Before paying underlying assets for minting, the minter must reserve collateral and pay a collateral reservation fee.

Parameters:

- `_agentVault`: Agent vault address
- `_lots`: Number of lots for which to reserve collateral
- `_maxMintingFeeBIPS`: Maximum minting fee (BIPS) that can be charged by the agent - best practice is to copy the current agent's published fee; used to prevent agent from front-running reservation request and increasing fee
- `_executor`: Account that is allowed to execute minting (besides minter and agent)

```solidity
function reserveCollateral(
    address _agentVault,
    uint256 _lots,
    uint256 _maxMintingFeeBIPS,
    address payable _executor,
) external payable;
```

## Execute Minting

### `executeMinting`

After obtaining proof of underlying payment, the minter calls this method to finish the minting and collect the minted FAssets.

Note: May only be called by:

- The minter (creator of the collateral reservation request)
- The executor appointed by the minter
- The agent owner (owner of the agent vault in the collateral reservation)

Parameters:

- `_payment`: Proof of the underlying payment (must contain exact `value + fee` amount and correct payment reference)
- `_collateralReservationId`: Collateral reservation ID

```solidity
function executeMinting(
    IPayment.Proof calldata _payment,
    uint256 _collateralReservationId
) external nonReentrant;
```

## Redemption

### `redeem`

Redeem number of lots of FAssets.

Returns the actual redeemed amount.

Parameters:

- `_lots`: Number of lots to redeem.
- `_redeemerUnderlyingAddressString`: The address to which the agent must transfer underlying amount.
- `_executor`: The account that is allowed to execute redemption default (besides redeemer and agent).

```solidity
function redeem(
    uint256 _lots,
    string memory _redeemerUnderlyingAddressString,
    address payable _executor
) external payable
    returns (uint256 _redeemedAmountUBA);
```

### `redemptionPaymentDefault`

If the agent fails to transfer the redeemed underlying assets in a timely manner, the redeemer or appointed executor can invoke this method and receive payment in collateral.
The agent can also call default if the redeemer is unresponsive to payout the redeemer and free the remaining collateral.

Parameters:

- `_proof`: Proof that the agent did not pay with correct payment reference on the underlying chain.
- `_redemptionRequestId`: ID of an existing redemption request.

```solidity
function redemptionPaymentDefault(
    IReferencedPaymentNonexistence.Proof calldata _proof,
    uint256 _redemptionRequestId
) external;
```

## Core Vault Settings

Reference for managing and interacting with FAssets `ICoreVaultSettings` contract which is inherited by the `IAssetManager` contract.

---

### `getCoreVaultManager`

```solidity
function getCoreVaultManager()
    external view
    returns (address);
```

### `getCoreVaultMinimumAmountLeftBIPS`

Returns the minimum amount of minting left on agent's address after transfer to core vault.

```solidity
function getCoreVaultMinimumAmountLeftBIPS()
  external view
  returns (uint256);
```

#### `getCoreVaultTransferTimeExtensionSeconds`

Returns the extra time for an agent's transfer to the core vault.

```solidity
function getCoreVaultTransferTimeExtensionSeconds()
  external view
  returns (uint256);
```

### `getCoreVaultTransferFeeBIPS`

```solidity
function getCoreVaultTransferFeeBIPS()
  external view
  returns (uint256);
```

### `getCoreVaultMinimumRedeemLots`

Returns the minimum number of lots that a direct redemption from core vault can take.

```solidity
function getCoreVaultMinimumRedeemLots()
  external view
  returns (uint256);
```

### `getCoreVaultRedemptionFeeBIPS`
