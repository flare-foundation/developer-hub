Command line reference for managing and interacting with FAssets `IAssetManager`.

Sourced from `IAssetManager.sol` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/IAssetManager.sol).

## Functions

### `getSettings`

Returns the complete asset manager settings as the [`AssetManagerSettings`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/data/AssetManagerSettings.sol) struct.

You can find detailed explanations of each parameter in the [FAssets Operational Parameters](/fassets/operational-parameters/#asset-manager-operational-parameters) documentation.

```solidity
function getSettings()
    external view
    returns (AssetManagerSettings.Data memory);
```

### `getAgentInfo`

Returns detailed information about an agent as the [`AgentInfo`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/data/AgentInfo.sol) struct.

Need to provide the agent vault address.

You can find detailed explanations of each agent parameter in the [FAssets Operational Parameters](/fassets/operational-parameters/#default-agent-settings) documentation.

```solidity
function getAgentInfo(address _agentVault)
    external view
    returns (AgentInfo.Info memory);
```

### `collateralReservationFee`

Returns the collateral reservation fee amount that has to be passed to the `reserveCollateral` method. Returns the amount in NAT wei.

Parameters:

- `_lots`: The number of lots for which to reserve collateral

### `reserveCollateral`

Reserves collateral for minting FAssets.
Before paying underlying assets for minting, the minter must reserve collateral and pay a collateral reservation fee.

Parameters:

- `_agentVault`: Agent vault address
- `_lots`: Number of lots for which to reserve collateral
- `_maxMintingFeeBIPS`: Maximum minting fee (BIPS) that can be charged by the agent - best practice is to copy the current agent's published fee; used to prevent agent from front-running reservation request and increasing fee
- `_executor`: Account that is allowed to execute minting (besides minter and agent)
- `_minterUnderlyingAddresses`: Array of minter's underlying addresses - needed only if handshake is required

```solidity
function reserveCollateral(
    address _agentVault,
    uint256 _lots,
    uint256 _maxMintingFeeBIPS,
    address payable _executor,
    string[] calldata _minterUnderlyingAddresses
) external payable;
```

### `collateralReservationInfo`

Returns the data about the collateral reservation for an ongoing minting.
Note: once the minting is executed or defaulted, the collateral reservation is deleted and this method fails.

Parameters:

- `_collateralReservationId`: The collateral reservation ID, as used for executing or defaulting the minting

```solidity
function collateralReservationInfo(uint256 _collateralReservationId)
    external view
    returns (CollateralReservationInfo.Data memory);
```

### `approveCollateralReservation`

Agent approves the collateral reservation request after checking the minter's identity.

Parameters:

- `_collateralReservationId`: Collateral reservation ID

```solidity
function approveCollateralReservation(
    uint256 _collateralReservationId
) external notEmergencyPaused;
```

### `rejectCollateralReservation`

Agent rejects the collateral reservation request after checking the minter's identity.
The collateral reservation fee is returned to the minter.

Parameters:

- `_collateralReservationId`: Collateral reservation ID

```solidity
function rejectCollateralReservation(
    uint256 _collateralReservationId
) external nonReentrant;
```

### `cancelCollateralReservation`

Minter cancels the collateral reservation request if the agent didn't respond in time.
The collateral reservation fee is returned to the minter.

Parameters:

- `_collateralReservationId`: Collateral reservation ID

```solidity
function cancelCollateralReservation(
    uint256 _collateralReservationId
) external nonReentrant;
```

### `collateralReservationFee`

Returns the collateral reservation fee amount.

Parameters:

- `_lots`: The number of lots for which to reserve collateral

Returns:

- `_reservationFeeNATWei`: The amount of reservation fee in NAT wei

```solidity
function collateralReservationFee(
    uint256 _lots
) external view returns (uint256 _reservationFeeNATWei);
```

### `executeMinting`

After obtaining proof of underlying payment, the minter calls this method to finish the minting and collect the minted FAssets.

Note: May only be called by:

- The minter (creator of the collateral reservation request)
- The executor appointed by the minter
- The agent owner (owner of the agent vault in the collateral reservation)

Parameters:

- `_payment`: Proof of the underlying payment (must contain exact `value + fee` amount and correct payment reference)
- `_collateralReservationId`: Collateral reservation ID

```solidity
function executeMinting(
    IPayment.Proof calldata _payment,
    uint256 _collateralReservationId
) external nonReentrant;
```

### `redeem`

Redeem number of lots of FAssets.

Returns the actual redeemed amount.

Parameters:

- `_lots`: Number of lots to redeem.
- `_redeemerUnderlyingAddressString`: The address to which the agent must transfer underlying amount.
- `_executor`: The account that is allowed to execute redemption default (besides redeemer and agent).

```solidity
function redeem(
    uint256 _lots,
    string memory _redeemerUnderlyingAddressString,
    address payable _executor
) external payable
    returns (uint256 _redeemedAmountUBA);
```

### `redemptionQueue`

Returns the redemption queue in the form of an array of [`RedemptionTicketInfo`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/data/RedemptionTicketInfo.sol) structs.

Parameters:

- `_firstRedemptionTicketId`: the ticket id to start listing from; if `0`, starts from the beginning
- `_pageSize`: the maximum number of redemption tickets to return

Returns:

- `_queue`: the (part of) the redemption queue; maximum length is \_pageSize
- `_nextRedemptionTicketId`: works as a cursor - if the `_pageSize` is reached and there are more tickets, it is the first ticket id not returned; if the end is reached, it is 0

```solidity
function redemptionQueue(
    uint256 _firstRedemptionTicketId,
    uint256 _pageSize
) external view
    returns (RedemptionTicketInfo.Data[] memory _queue, uint256 _nextRedemptionTicketId);
```

### `agentRedemptionQueue`

Returns the redemption queue for specific agent in the form of an array of [`RedemptionTicketInfo`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fassets/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/data/RedemptionTicketInfo.sol) structs.

Parameters:

- `_agentVault`: the agent vault address of the queried agent
- `_firstRedemptionTicketId`: the ticket id to start listing from; if `0`, starts from the beginning
- `_pageSize`: the maximum number of redemption tickets to return

Returns:

- `_queue`: the (part of) the redemption queue; maximum length is \_pageSize
- `_nextRedemptionTicketId`: works as a cursor - if the` _pageSize` is reached and there are more tickets, it is the first ticket id not returned; if the end is reached, it is 0

```solidity
function agentRedemptionQueue(
    address _agentVault,
    uint256 _firstRedemptionTicketId,
    uint256 _pageSize
) external view
    returns (RedemptionTicketInfo.Data[] memory _queue, uint256 _nextRedemptionTicketId);
```
