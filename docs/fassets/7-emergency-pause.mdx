## Overview

The FAssets system includes a structured **three-level emergency pause mechanism** that allows governance to selectively restrict operations in response to planned upgrades, critical failures, or security threats.
Each level defines a different scope of restrictions, ensuring a balance between **security, system availability, and user protection**.

## Emergency Pause Levels

### Start Operations

This level is intended for scenarios like network upgrades or planned maintenance.
The goal is to prevent anyone from initiating new actions while allowing operations already in progress to complete before proceeding with maintenance.

#### Halted Operations

- **User/Agent Operations**: [minting](/fassets/minting), [redeeming](/fassets/redemption), [liquidation](/fassets/liquidation), [destroy agent](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#close-agent-vault), [collateral withdrawal](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#withdraw-vault-collateral), [exit available](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#exit-available).
- **One-Step Operations**: [self mint](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#self-mint-fasset), [self close](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#self-close), [enter](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#enter-available), [create agent](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#create).
- **Collateral Pool Operations**: [enter](/fassets/reference/user-bot#enter-pool), [exit](/fassets/reference/user-bot#exit-pool), [withdraw fees](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#withdraw-vault-collateral-1), [pay fee debt](/fassets/collateral#minting-fees-and-debt), [delegate pool collateral](/fassets/reference/agent-bot#delegate-pool-collateral).

#### Use Cases

- Scheduled network upgrades.
- System configuration or parameter changes.
- Non-critical security patches.

### Full

This level is designed for critical emergencies.
It halts practically all activity while preserving essential system functions.

#### Halted Operations

Stops almost everything, except:

- **FAsset transfers**, but users can still move their assets.
- **Settings modifications**, but governance can still adjust parameters.
- **System upgrades**, but critical updates can still be deployed.

#### Use Cases

- Confirmed security vulnerabilities.
- Market manipulation attempts.
- Critical system failures.
- Regulatory compliance requirements.

### Full and Transfer

The most restrictive level that freezes all transactional activity, including asset transfers.

#### Halted Operations

This is identical to the FULL level, but it also stops the **FAsset transfers**.
It completely freezes all movement of the FAssets.

#### Use Cases

- Severe security breaches.
- Complete system compromise.
- Emergency asset protection.
- Extreme market conditions.

## Conclusion

The FAssets emergency pause system provides a robust framework for maintaining system security and stability during critical situations.
The system can respond appropriately to various types of threats while maintaining essential functionality and protecting user assets.
