## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to retrieve information about a Firelight vault, including vault metrics, period configuration, user balances, and withdrawal information.

The Firelight vault is an [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) vault architecture compatible with [FAssets](/fassets/overview).

## Prerequisites

- [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit)
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts)
- Understanding of [FAssets](/fassets/overview)

## Firelight Vault Status Script

The following script retrieves and displays information about the Firelight vault:

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/firelight/status.ts">
  {FirelightStatus}
</CodeBlock>

## Script Breakdown

The script retrieves the following information:

1. **Asset Information**: Token address, symbol, and decimals.
2. **Vault Balances**: Total assets, total supply (shares), and exchange rate.
3. **Period Configuration**: Current period details and timing information.
   Firelight vaults operate on a [period-based logic](https://docs.firelight.finance/technical-documents#period-based-logic).
4. **User Information**: User balances (shares and assets), and maximum limits for deposit, mint, withdraw, and redeem.
5. **User Withdrawals and Redemptions**: Pending withdrawals and redemptions for the current and previous periods.

## Running the Script

To run the Firelight vault status script:

1. Ensure you have the [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) set up.
2. Update the `FIRELIGHT_VAULT_ADDRESS` constant with the correct vault address for your network.
3. Run the script using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/firelight/status.ts --network coston2
```

## Output

The script outputs the following information:
