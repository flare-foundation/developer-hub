## Overview

When building on the Flare Network, it is important to **avoid hardcoding contract addresses**, especially for key components such as the FXRP Asset Manager.
These addresses can change between Flare testnets and mainnet deployments, and relying on fixed values can lead to broken integrations.

Instead, you should dynamically fetch the FXRP Asset Manager address using the [Flare Contract Registry](/network/guides/flare-contracts-registry), the trusted source for obtaining contract addresses on any Flare network.

In this guide, you will learn:

- How to retrieve the [Asset Manager Controller](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerController) using the Flare Contract Registry.
- How to find the specific FXRP [Asset Manager](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager).
- A sample Solidity contract that encapsulates this logic.

## Sample code

To get the [FAssets asset manager](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager) address, you can use the following smart contract that retrieves the [Asset Manager Controller](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerController) address from the [Flare contract registry](/network/guides/flare-contracts-registry).

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/AssetManagerRegistry.sol">
  {AssetManagerRegistry}
</CodeBlock>

### Contract Breakdown

1. Imports the necessary interfaces and libraries from the [Flare Periphery Contracts package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts).
2. Defines a constant `TXRP_HASH` that is the hash of the string `TXRP`.
   This is used to identify the FXRP asset manager.
3. Implements a function `getFxrpAssetManager` that returns the FXRP [Asset Manager](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager) address.
4. Uses the `ContractRegistry` library from the Flare Periphery Contracts package to get the [Asset Manager Controller](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerController) address from the Flare contract registry.
5. Uses the `IAssetManagerController` interface from the Flare Periphery Contracts package to get all the asset managers from the Asset Manager Controller.
6. Iterates over the asset managers and returns the FXRP Asset Manager address.
7. Gets the settings of the asset manager.
8. Checks if the pool token suffix is `TXRP` and if true returns the FXRP Asset Manager address.

You can find out this sample code in the [Flare starter kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit).

:::tip Reusable Library

To reuse this code to get the FXRP Asset Manager address in other smart contracts, you can wrap it in a reusable library.
This is useful if you want to use the FXRP Asset Manager address in multiple smart contracts and avoid repeating the same code.

## Next Steps

In this guide, you learned how to get the FXRP Asset Manager address for the FAssets system by interacting with the `AssetManager` contract using the [`IAssetManager`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager) interface.

You should not hardcode the FXRP Asset Manager address in your smart contracts.

To continue your FAssets development journey, you can:

- Learn how to [mint FXRP](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-mint).
- Understand how to [redeem FXRP](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-redeem).
- Explore [FAssets system settings](/fassets/operational-parameters).
