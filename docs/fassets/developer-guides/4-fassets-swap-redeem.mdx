## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to swap a token (in this example, WCFLR) for FXRP and redeem FXRP for FAssets using the Uniswap V2 router (in this example, BlazeSwap) and the FAssets asset manager.

## Swap and Redeem Smart Contract

The following Solidity contract demonstrates how to swap WCFLR for FXRP and then redeem FXRP to receive XRP on the XRPL.

### Contract Code

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/fassets/SwapAndRedeem.sol">
  {FAssetsSwapAndRedeemContract}
</CodeBlock>

This contract has two main functions:

- Swaps WCFLR for FXRP using a BlazeSwap router (Uniswap V2 compatible).
- Redeems FAssets (FXRP) to an XRPL address using the FAssets asset manager.

### 1. Required Imports

The contract uses the following dependencies:

- `IERC20` OpenZeppelin standard ERC-20 interface.
- `IAssetManager` interface to the FAssets Asset Manager.
- `AssetManagerSettings` is used to retrieve lot size and configuration.

### 2. Interfaces

The `ISwapRouter` interface allows interaction with a Uniswap V2-compatible router:

- `swapExactTokensForTokens`: Swaps an exact amount of input tokens.
- `getAmountsIn`: Calculates how much input is needed for a given output.

### 3. State Variables and Constructor

Defined state variables:

- `router`: Uniswap V2 router contract; in this example, it is the BlazeSwap router.
- `assetManager`: Asset Manager handling FXRP redemption.
- `token`: Token to swap (WCFLR in the swap path).
- `swapPath`: Array of addresses defining the swap route (e.g., WCFLR â†’ FXRP).

To instantiate the contract, the constructor sets up the Uniswap router, FAssets asset manager, and swap path.
It initializes the token as the first token in the swap path.

### 4. Main Function: `swapAndRedeem`

The `swapAndRedeem` is the core function that executes the swap and redemption flow.

- **1. Validation**

  - Ensure the caller has sufficient WCFLR balance.
  - Confirm the contract has enough FXRP allowance for redemption.

- **2. Transfer**

  - Move WCFLR from the caller to the contract.
  - Approve the router to spend WCFLR on behalf of the contract.

- **3. Swap**

  - Perform the swap from WCFLR to FXRP using the specified swap path.
  - Apply a 10-minute deadline for the swap operation.

- **4. Redemption**

  - Redeem the obtained FXRP through the FAssets system.
  - Transfer the resulting XRP to the caller's XRPL address.

- **5. Helper Function: `calculateRedemptionAmountIn`**
  - Accept the number of FXRP lots intended for redemption.
  - Fetch the lot size from the FAssets asset manager and calculate the WCFLR needed for swap and redemption.

## Execute the Swap and Redeem

To execute the swap and redeem process, you need to deploy the smart contract instance and call the `swapAndRedeem` function.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/swapAndRedeem.ts">
  {FAssetsSwapAndRedeemScript}
</CodeBlock>

### Code Breakdown

- **1. Dependencies and Constants**

  - `ASSET_MANAGER_ADDRESS`: The address of the FAssets Asset Manager contract.
  - `LOTS_TO_REDEEM`: The number of FAsset lots to redeem (typically set to 1).
  - `UNDERLYING_ADDRESS`: The XRPL address that will receive the redeemed assets.
  - `SWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS`: The address of the Uniswap V2-compatible swap router.
  - `SWAP_PATH`: An array of token addresses defining the swap path from WCFLR to FXRP.

- **2. Deploy and Verify**

  - Deploys the `SwapAndRedeem` contract and verifies it using [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit).

- **3. Calculate Redemption Amounts**

  - Calls `calculateRedemptionAmountIn` to determine the required WCFLR amount.

- **4. Approve Tokens**

  - Uses the ERC-20 `approve` method to allow the contract to spend WCFLR.
    :::warning
    In a production environment, you should use a secure method to approve spending the tokens.
    :::

- **5. Execute the Swap and Redemption**
  - Calls `swapAndRedeem` to complete the FAssets redemption process.

### Run the Script

To run the script, use the [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) with the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/fassets/swapAndRedeem.ts --network coston
```

The script outputs transaction details, including swap amounts and redemption results.

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to:

- swap WCFLR for FXRP using Uniswap V2 compatible router (in this example, BlazeSwap);
- redeem FXRP to XRP on the XRP Ledger using FAssets asset manager.
