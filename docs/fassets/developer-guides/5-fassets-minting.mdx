## Overview

This guide walks you through the complete process of minting FAssets (e.g., FXRP) on the Flare network.

Minting FAssets is the process of wrapping, for instance, XRP from the XRP Ledger into an FAsset, enabling it to be used within the Flare blockchain ecosystem.

See the [Minting](/fassets/minting) overview for more details.

## Prerequisites

- [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit)
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts)

## Minting Process Steps

The minting process is a multi-step process that involves the following steps:

1. Reserve collateral from a suitable agent.
2. Send the underlying asset (e.g., XRP) to the agent.
3. Use [Flare Data Connector (FDC)](/fdc/overview) to generate proof of payment.
4. Execute minting with the proof to receive FAssets.

## Reserve Collateral

The following code demonstrates how to reserve collateral by calling the [`reserveCollateral`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#reservecollateral) function on the AssetManager contract.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/reserveCollateral.ts">
  {FAssetsReserveCollateral}
</CodeBlock>

### Collateral Reservation Script Breakdown

1. Define constants

- `LOTS_TO_MINT`: Number of FAsset lots to reserve.
- `ZERO_ADDRESS`: Placeholder for `executor` (not used in this script).

2. Retrieve and filter agents with enough free collateral and select the agent with the lowest fee and normal status.
3. Parse [`CollateralReserved`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#collateralreserved) event.
4. Start the minting reservation process at the script's entry point.
5. Call `findBestAgent` with the required number of lots.
6. Get the asset manager from the [Flare Contract Registry](/network/guides/flare-contracts-registry).
7. Find the best agent with enough free collateral lots.
8. Fetch agent metadata from [`getAgentInfo`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#getagentinfo) to get the agent's `feeBIPS`, which is used to calculate the collateral reservation fee.
9. Calculate the collateral reservation fee by calling [`collateralReservationFee`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#collateralreservationfee).
10. Reserve collateral from agent by calling [`reserveCollateral`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#reservecollateral)
11. Call `assetMintingDecimals` to determine the XRP token's decimal precision.
12. Parse the [`CollateralReserved`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#collateralreserved) event.
13. Calculate the total XRP value required for payment.

## Send Payment on XRP Ledger

The next step is to send the XRP Ledger payment to the agent, and you can use this script to do that.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/xrpPayment.ts">
  {FAssetsCreateXrpPayment}
</CodeBlock>

### XRP Payment Script Breakdown

1. Install the `xrpl` package â€” it's not included in the Flare Hardhat Starter Kit by default.
2. Specify the correct constants from the reserve collateral script:
   - `AGENT_ADDRESS` - Agent's XRP Ledger address.
   - `AMOUNT_XRP` - XRP amount to send.
   - `PAYMENT_REFERENCE` - Payment reference from the the reserve collateral script.
3. Create a client to connect to the XRP Ledger Testnet.
4. Load the sender wallet.
5. Construct the payment transaction.
6. Sign and submit the transaction.

## Generate Proof with Flare Data Connector

Use the [FDC Payment](/fdc/guides/hardhat/payment) script to validate the XRP payment and generate a Merkle proof.

## Execute Minting

Once the XRP payment is validated, you can retrieve the FDC proof from the [Data Availability Layer](/fdc/overview#data-availability-layer) and call the [`executeMinting`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#executeminting) function on the AssetManager contract.

This script demonstrates how to retrieve the FDC proof and execute minting.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/executeMinting.ts">
  {FAssetsExecuteMinting}
</CodeBlock>

### Execute Minting Script Breakdown

1. Get environment variables.
2. Set the collateral reservation ID to the previously reserved minting request.
3. Set the FDC round ID to retrieve the proof.
4. Provide the FDC request data.
5. Import the Asset manager contract artifact.
6. Define the function to prepare the FDC request.
7. Create a function to get the proof from the FDC.
   It sends a POST request to the [Flare Data Availability Layer](/fdc/overview#data-availability-layer) and returns a Merkle proof and attestation response from FDC.
8. Define the function to parse the events.
9. Retrieve the FDC proof from the Data Availability Layer.
10. Call the [`executeMinting`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#executeminting) function on the AssetManager contract and send a transaction to the Flare network to convert the attested XRP payment into FXRP (minting).
11. On a successful transaction call `parseExecutemintingEvents` to extract and log events [`RedemptionTicketCreated`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#redemptionticketcreated) and [`MintingExecuted`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#mintingexecuted).

## Next Steps

Now that you have successfully minted FAssets, you can use them in Flare dApps or transfer them to other users or smart contracts within the Flare ecosystem.

To convert your FAssets (e.g., FXRP) back into the original asset (e.g., XRP), follow the steps in the [FAssets Redemption Guide](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-redeem).
