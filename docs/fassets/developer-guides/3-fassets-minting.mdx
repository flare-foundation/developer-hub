## Overview

This guide walks you through the complete process of minting FAssets (e.g., FXRP) on the Flare network.

Minting FAssets is the process of wrapping, for instance, XRP from the XRP Ledger into an FAsset, enabling it to be used within the Flare blockchain ecosystem.

See the [Minting](/fassets/minting) overview for more details.

## Prerequisites

- [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit)
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts)

## Minting Process Steps

The minting process is a multi-step process that involves the following steps:

1. Reserve collateral from a suitable agent.
2. Send the underlying asset (e.g., XRP) to the agent.
3. Use [Flare Data Connector (FDC)](/fdc/overview) to generate proof of payment.
4. Execute minting with the proof to receive FAssets.

## Reserve Collateral

The following code demonstrates how to reserve collateral by calling the [`reserveCollateral()`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#reservecollateral) function on the AssetManager contract.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/reserveCollateral.ts">
  {FAssetsReserveCollateral}
</CodeBlock>

### Collateral Reservation Script Breakdown

1. Define constants

- `ASSET_MANAGER_ADDRESS`: FXRP AssetManager address on Songbird Testnet (Coston).
- `LOTS_TO_MINT`: Number of FAsset lots to reserve.
- `UNDERLYING_ADDRESS`: Target XRP Ledger address for the minted asset.
- `ZERO_ADDRESS`: Placeholder for `executor` (not used in this script).

2. Retrieve and filter agents with enough free collateral and select the agent with the lowest fee and normal status.
3. Parse [`CollateralReserved`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#collateralreserved) event.
4. The script's entry point is where the minting reservation process starts.
5. Call `findBestAgent()` with the required number of lots.
6. Fetch agent metadata from [`getAgentInfo()`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#getagentinfo) to get the agent's `feeBIPS`, which is used to calculate the collateral reservation fee.
7. Calculate the collateral reservation fee by calling [`collateralReservationFee()`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#collateralreservationfee).
8. Reserve collateral from agent by calling [`reserveCollateral()`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#reservecollateral)
9. Call `assetMintingDecimals()` to determine the XRP token's decimal precision.
10. Parse the [`CollateralReserved`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#collateralreserved) event.
11. Calculate the total XRP value required for payment.

## Send Payment on XRP Ledger

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/xrpPayment.ts">
  {FAssetsCreateXrpPayment}
</CodeBlock>

### XRP Payment Script Breakdown

1. Install the `xrpl` package with `npm install xrpl` — it's not included in the Flare Hardhat Starter Kit by default.
2. Define the needed constants.
3. Create a client to connect to the XRP Ledger Testnet.
4. Load the sender wallet.
5. Construct the payment transaction.
6. Sign and submit the transaction.

## Generate Proof with Flare Data Connector

Use the [FDC Payment](/fdc/guides/hardhat/payment) script to generate a Merkle proof by providing the XRP transaction details.

FDC returns an attestation response with the required proof structure to execute minting.

## Execute Minting

Once you have the proof, call [`executeMinting()`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#executeminting) to mint FAssets.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/executeMinting.ts">
  {FAssetsExecuteMinting}
</CodeBlock>

### Execute Minting Script Breakdown

1. Get environment variables.
2. Declare the constant `ASSET_MANAGER_ADDRESS` pointing to the FXRP AssetManager on the Songbird Testnet (Coston network).

3. Set the collateral reservation ID to the previously reserved minting request.
4. Set the Flare Data Connector (FDC) round ID to retrieve the proof for.
5. Prepare the FDC request payload data.
6. Function to get the proof from the FDC. It sends a POST request to the [Flare Data Availability Layer](/fdc/overview#data-availability-layer) and returns a Merkle proof and attestation response from FDC.
7. Retrieve the FDC proof from the Data Availability Layer.
8. Call the [`executeMinting()`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#executeminting) function on the AssetManager contract and send a transaction to the Flare network to convert the attested XRP payment into FXRP (minting).
9. On a successful transaction call `parseExecutemintingEvents()` to extract and log events [`RedemptionTicketCreated`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#redemptionticketcreated) and [`MintingExecuted`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#mintingexecuted).

## Next Steps

Now that you have successfully minted FAssets, you can use them in Flare dApps or transfer them to other users or smart contracts within the Flare ecosystem.

To convert your FAssets (e.g., FXRP) back into the original asset (e.g., XRP), follow the steps in the [FAssets Redemption Guide](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-redeem).
