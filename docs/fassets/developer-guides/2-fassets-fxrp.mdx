## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to get the [FXRP](/fassets/reference) address for the FAssets system.
FXRP is the ERC-20 representation of XRP on the Flare network, enabling you to use XRP in smart contracts and DeFi applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) installed and configured.
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) installed in your project.
- Basic understanding of [FAssets](/fassets/overview) and how they work.

## Understanding FXRP Address

The FXRP address is the contract address of the [ERC-20 token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) that represents XRP on the Flare network and is essential for:

- Interacting with FXRP in smart contracts.
- Transferring FXRP tokens.
- Participating in DeFi protocols that use FXRP.

## Getting the FXRP Address

To get the FXRP address, you need to interact with the `AssetManager` contract using the [`IAssetManager`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager) interface and call the [`fAsset`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#fasset) function.
This function returns the address of the FAsset token contract (ERC-20) that is managed by this asset manager instance.

### Script Code

The following TypeScript script demonstrates how to retrieve the FXRP address:

<CodeBlock language="javascript" title="scripts/fassets/getFXRP.ts">
  {FAssetsGetFxrpScript}
</CodeBlock>

### Code Explanation

The script:

1. Connects to the `AssetManager` contract using the [`IAssetManager`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager) interface.
2. Calls the [`fAsset`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#fasset) function to get the FXRP token address.
3. Logs the address to the console.

:::info
The `getFXRPAssetManagerAddress` function is a utility function that is included in the [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit).
It is used to get the FXRP Asset Manager address from the Flare Contract Registry.
:::

### Run the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/fassets/getFXRP.ts --network coston2
```

The script will output the FXRP address for the FAssets system on the Coston2 network:

```bash
FXRP address 0x8b4abA9C4BD7DD961659b02129beE20c6286e17F
```

:::note Network Addresses
The FXRP address will be different depending on which network you are using.

## Using the FXRP Address

Once you have the FXRP address, you can:

1. Use it in your smart contracts to interact with FXRP
2. Add it to your wallet to track FXRP balances
3. Use it in DeFi protocols that support FXRP

## Next Steps

In this guide, you learned how to get the FXRP address for the FAssets system by interacting with the `AssetManager` contract using the [`IAssetManager`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager) interface.

To continue your FAssets development journey, you can:

- Learn how to [mint FXRP](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-mint).
- Understand how to [redeem FXRP](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-redeem).
- Explore [FAssets system settings](/fassets/operational-parameters).
- Check the [lot size](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-settings-node) for FXRP operations.
