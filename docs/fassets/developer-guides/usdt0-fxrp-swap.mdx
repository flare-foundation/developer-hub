## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to swap USDT0 to FXRP using the Uniswap V3 router (SparkDEX).
FXRP is the ERC-20 representation of XRP used by [FAssets](/fassets/overview).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Basic understanding of the [FAssets system](/fassets/overview).
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) package installed.
- Familiarity with [Uniswap V3 swaps](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/swaps/single-swaps).

## Required Addresses on Flare Mainnet

- V3 SwapRouter (SparkDEX): [0x8a1E35F5c98C4E85B36B7B253222eE17773b2781](https://flarescan.com/address/0x8a1E35F5c98C4E85B36B7B253222eE17773b2781/contract/14/code).
- USDT0: [0xe7cd86e13AC4309349F30B3435a9d337750fC82D](https://flarescan.com/address/0xe7cd86e13AC4309349F30B3435a9d337750fC82D).

## Solidity Uniswap V3 Wrapper Contract

This Solidity contract wraps the Uniswap V3 router, providing safe token transfers, pool checks, and event logging for debugging.

### Code Explanation

1. Define the Uniswap V3 router function for swaps, which allows interaction with the Uniswap V3 protocol.
   It comes from the [Uniswap V3 periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery).

2. Use the Uniswap V3 factory interface to locate a specific pool for a token pair and the fee tier.

3. Define the Uniswap V3 pool interface that provides liquidity and token details for a given pool.

4. Create the `UniswapV3Wrapper` contract, which acts as a wrapper around Uniswap V3 to simplify swaps and add safety checks.

5. Use the existing Uniswap V3 SwapRouter on Flare (SparkDEX) as the main entry point for executing swaps.

6. Store the Uniswap V3 factory in the contract for looking up pools.

7. Define events that log important actions such as swaps executed, pools checked, and tokens approved.

8. Create a constructor that initializes the swap router and factory.

9. Check if the pool exists and has liquidity, preventing the swaps execution in empty or non-existent pools.

10. Create a swap exact input single function that executes a single-hop swap through the Uniswap V3 router protocol.

    10.1. Check if pool exists, ensuring a valid pool address is returned.

    10.2. Check if the pool has liquidity, requiring the available liquidity is greater than zero.

    10.3. Transfer tokens from the user to this contract, using SafeERC20 for secure transfers.

    10.4. Approve the router to spend tokens using the `SafeERC20` library, allowing the router to perform the swap.

    10.5. Prepare swap parameters, filling the `ExactInputSingleParams` struct with all necessary details.

    10.6. Execute the swap, calling the `swapRouter.exactInputSingle` function to perform the transaction.

    10.7. Emit the swap executed event, logging details about the user, tokens, and amounts.

## Execute the Swap with Hardhat

To execute a swap, you need to deploy the wrapper contract and call `swapExactInputSingle` with the swap parameters.

<CodeBlock
  language="typescript"
  title="scripts/fassets/swapExactInputSingle.ts"
>
  {UniswapV3WrapperScript}
</CodeBlock>

### Code Breakdown

1. Import contract artifacts, including `IAssetManager`, `UniswapV3Wrapper`, and `ERC20`, which provide access to the deployed contracts.

2. Define Flare Uniswap V3 addresses (SparkDEX), specifying the SwapRouter address used for executing swaps.

3. Set the USDT0 token address on Flare Mainnet, which represents the stablecoin used as the input asset for the swap.

4. Set the pool fee tier to 500 (0.05%), which defines the fee level of the pool to use on the Uniswap V3 router (SparkDEX).

5. Define swap parameters.

6. Define the function `deployAndVerifyContract()` that deploys the UniswapV3Wrapper contract and verifies it on the blockchain explorer.

7. Create the `setupAndInitializeTokens()` function that prepares accounts and ERC20 contracts.

8. Define the `verifyPoolAndLiquidity()` function which ensures the USDT0/FXRP pool exists and is usable.

9. Create the `approveUsdt0ForSwap()` function that approves the wrapper contract to spend USDT0 on behalf of the deployer.

10. Create the `executeSparkDexSwap()` function that executes the swap on SparkDEX using the Uniswap V3 wrapper.

11. Create the `checkFinalBalances()` function that verifies the swap results.

12. Create the `main()` function that orchestrates the entire flow of the swap.

### Run the Script

To run the script, you need to execute the following command:

```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/fassets/uniswapV3Wrapper.ts --network flare
```
