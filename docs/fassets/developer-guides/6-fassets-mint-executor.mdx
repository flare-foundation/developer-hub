## Overview

This guide walks you through the complete process of minting FAssets (e.g., FXRP) on the Flare network using the [executor](/fassets/minting#executor-role).

Minting FAssets is the process of wrapping, for instance, XRP from the XRP Ledger into an FAsset, enabling it to be used within the Flare blockchain ecosystem.

:::info

Executors are external actors that monitor pending minting requests and execute them by submitting payment proofs on-chain.
They are incentivized for this task but have no special permissions—anyone can act as an executor.
If no one executes in time, the minting request expires, and the process must be restarted.

An executor can be a wallet or a DApp platform that facilitates minting and helps users automate the flow.

See the [Minting](/fassets/minting) overview for more details.

## Prerequisites

- [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit)
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts)

## Minting Process Steps

The minting process involves the following steps:

1. Reserve collateral from a suitable agent and nominate an executor.
2. Send the underlying asset (e.g., XRP) to the agent.
3. Use [Flare Data Connector (FDC)](/fdc/overview) to generate a proof of payment.
4. Execute minting with the proof as a parameter to receive FAssets.

## Reserve Collateral

The following code demonstrates how to reserve collateral by calling the [`reserveCollateral`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#reservecollateral) function on the AssetManager contract.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/reserveCollateral.ts">
  {FAssetsReserveCollateralWithExecutor}
</CodeBlock>

### Collateral Reservation Script Breakdown

1. Define constants

- `LOTS_TO_MINT`: Number of FAssets [lots](/fassets/minting#lots) to reserve.
- `EXECUTOR_ADDRESS`: Executor address that will execute the minting process and provide the proof of underlying asset payment.

2. Get the AssetManager artifact
3. Retrieve and filter agents with enough free collateral and select the agent with the lowest fee and normal status.
4. Parse [`CollateralReserved`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#collateralreserved) event.
5. Start the minting reservation process at the script's entry point.
6. Get the asset manager artifact.
7. Call `findBestAgent` with the required number of lots.
8. Fetch agent metadata from [`getAgentInfo`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#getagentinfo) to get the agent's `feeBIPS`, which is used to calculate the collateral reservation fee.
9. Calculate the collateral reservation fee by calling [`collateralReservationFee`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#collateralreservationfee).
10. Set the executor fee the same as the collateral reservation fee to make this example simpler.
11. Reserve collateral from agent by calling [`reserveCollateral`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#reservecollateral) with the executor address.
    The executor fee is on top of the collateral reservation fee in native tokens.
    The fee is agreed between the minter and the executor.
12. Call `assetMintingDecimals` to determine the XRP token's decimal precision.
13. Parse the [`CollateralReserved`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#collateralreserved) event to get the collateral reservation ID and other important collateral reservation details.
14. Calculate the total XRP value required for payment.

## Send Payment on XRP Ledger

The next step is to send the XRP Ledger payment to the agent, and you can use this script to do that.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/xrpPayment.ts">
  {FAssetsCreateXrpPayment}
</CodeBlock>

### XRP Payment Script Breakdown

1. Install the `xrpl` package — it's not included in the Flare Hardhat Starter Kit by default.
2. Specify the correct constants from the reserve collateral script:
   - `AGENT_ADDRESS` - Agent's XRP Ledger address.
   - `AMOUNT_XRP` - XRP amount to send.
   - `PAYMENT_REFERENCE` - Payment reference from the the reserve collateral script.
3. Create a client to connect to the XRP Ledger Testnet.
4. Load the sender's wallet.
5. Construct the payment transaction.
6. Sign and submit the transaction.

## Generate Proof with Flare Data Connector

The executor will use the Flare Data Connector's [Payment attestastion type](/fdc/guides/hardhat/payment) to validate the XRP payment and generate a Merkle proof.

## Execute Minting

Once the XRP payment is validated, executor can retrieve the FDC proof from the [Data Availability Layer](/fdc/overview#data-availability-layer) and call the [`executeMinting`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#executeminting) function on the AssetManager contract.
Once the minting is executed, the executor will receive the executor fee in native tokens.
If the executor fails to execute in time, the request expires, and minting must be restarted.

This script demonstrates how to retrieve the FDC proof and execute minting.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/executeMinting.ts">
  {FAssetsExecuteMinting}
</CodeBlock>

### Execute Minting Script Breakdown

1. Get environment variables.
2. Declare the constant `ASSET_MANAGER_ADDRESS` pointing to the FXRP AssetManager on the Songbird Testnet (Coston network).

3. Set the collateral reservation ID to the previously reserved minting request.
4. Set the Flare Data Connector (FDC) round ID to retrieve the proof.
5. Prepare the FDC request payload data.
6. Create a function to get the proof from the FDC.
   It sends a POST request to the [Flare Data Availability Layer](/fdc/overview#data-availability-layer) and returns a Merkle proof and attestation response from FDC.
7. Retrieve the FDC proof from the Data Availability Layer.
8. Call the [`executeMinting`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManager#executeminting) function on the AssetManager contract and send a transaction to the Flare network to convert the attested XRP payment into FXRP (minting).
9. On a successful transaction call `parseExecutemintingEvents` to extract and log events [`RedemptionTicketCreated`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#redemptionticketcreated) and [`MintingExecuted`](/fassets/reference/IAssetManagerEvents#mintingexecuted).

## Next Steps

Now that you have successfully minted FAssets using the executor, you can use them in Flare dApps or transfer them to other users or smart contracts within the Flare ecosystem.

To convert your FAssets (e.g., FXRP) back into the original asset (e.g., XRP), follow the steps in the [FAssets Redemption Guide](/fassets/developer-guides/fassets-redeem).
