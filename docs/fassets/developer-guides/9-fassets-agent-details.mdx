## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to read FAssets agent details such as agent name, description, logo, and terms of use using the [AgentOwnerRegistry](/fassets/reference/IAgentOwnerRegistry) smart contract.
This information is essential for building user interfaces that display agent information or for validating agent credentials in your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of [FAssets system](/fassets/overview).
- [Flare Network Periphery Contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) package.

## Understanding FAssets Agents

FAssets agents are entities that manage the minting and redemption of FAssets tokens. Each agent has:

- **Management Address**: The address that controls the agent's operations.
- **Agent Name**: Agent's display name.
- **Description**: Detailed information about the agent.
- **Icon URL**: Link to the agent's logo or branding image.
- **Terms of Use URL**: Link to the agent's terms and conditions.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Get the AgentOwnerRegistry Contract Address

The [AgentOwnerRegistry](/fassets/reference/IAgentOwnerRegistry) contract address is stored in the FAssets Asset Manager settings.
Here's how to retrieve it:

```solidity
import {IAssetManager} from "@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts/coston2/IAssetManager.sol";
import {ContractRegistry} from "@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts/coston2/ContractRegistry.sol";

// Get the Asset Manager instance
IAssetManager assetManager = ContractRegistry.getAssetManagerFXRP();

// Retrieve the AgentOwnerRegistry address from settings
address agentOwnerRegistry = assetManager.getSettings().agentOwnerRegistry;
```

### Access the AgentOwnerRegistry Contract

Create an interface instance to interact with the AgentOwnerRegistry:

```solidity
import {IAgentOwnerRegistry} from "@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts/coston2/IAgentOwnerRegistry.sol";

IAgentOwnerRegistry agentOwnerRegistryContract = IAgentOwnerRegistry(agentOwnerRegistry);
```

### Read Agent Details

The [AgentOwnerRegistry](/fassets/reference/IAgentOwnerRegistry) provides several functions to retrieve agent information.
All functions require the agent's management address as a parameter:

#### Available Functions

- [`getAgentName(address _managementAddress)`](/fassets/reference/IAgentOwnerRegistry#getagentname) - Returns the agent's display name.
- [`getAgentDescription(address _managementAddress)`](/fassets/reference/IAgentOwnerRegistry#getagentdescription) - Returns the agent's description.
- [`getAgentIconUrl(address _managementAddress)`](/fassets/reference/IAgentOwnerRegistry#getagenticonurl) - Returns the URL to the agent's icon/logo.
- [`getAgentTermsOfUseUrl(address _managementAddress)`](/fassets/reference/IAgentOwnerRegistry#getagenttermsofuseurl) - Returns the URL to the agent's terms of use.

#### Complete Example Function

Here's a complete Solidity language function that retrieves all agent details in a single call:

```solidity
function getAgentDetails(address _managementAddress) external view
  returns (string memory name, string memory description, string memory iconUrl, string memory termsOfUseUrl) {

  // Get Asset Manager and AgentOwnerRegistry
  IAssetManager assetManager = ContractRegistry.getAssetManagerFXRP();
  address agentOwnerRegistryAddress = assetManager.getSettings().agentOwnerRegistry;
  IAgentOwnerRegistry agentOwnerRegistry = IAgentOwnerRegistry(agentOwnerRegistryAddress);

  // Retrieve all agent details
  name = agentOwnerRegistry.getAgentName(_managementAddress);
  description = agentOwnerRegistry.getAgentDescription(_managementAddress);
  iconUrl = agentOwnerRegistry.getAgentIconUrl(_managementAddress);
  termsOfUseUrl = agentOwnerRegistry.getAgentTermsOfUseUrl(_managementAddress);

  return (name, description, iconUrl, termsOfUseUrl);
}
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to read FAssets agent details using the [AgentOwnerRegistry](/fassets/reference/IAgentOwnerRegistry) smart contract.
This functionality is crucial for building user interfaces that display agent information and for validating agent credentials in your applications.
