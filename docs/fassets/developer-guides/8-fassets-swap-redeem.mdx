## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to swap a token (in this example, WCFLR) for FXRP and redeem FXRP for FAssets using the Uniswap V2 router (in this example, BlazeSwap) and the FAssets asset manager.

## Swap and Redeem Smart Contract

The following Solidity contract demonstrates how to swap WCFLR for FXRP and then redeem FXRP to receive XRP on the XRPL.

### Contract Code

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="contracts/fassets/SwapAndRedeem.sol">
  {FAssetsSwapAndRedeemContract}
</CodeBlock>

This contract has two main functions:

- Swaps WCFLR for FXRP using a BlazeSwap router (Uniswap V2 compatible).
- Redeems FAssets (FXRP) to an XRPL address using the FAssets asset manager.

### 1. Required Imports

The contract uses the following dependencies:

- `IERC20` OpenZeppelin standard ERC-20 interface.
- `IAssetManager` interface to the FAssets Asset Manager.
- `AssetManagerSettings` is used to retrieve lot size and configuration.

### 2. Interfaces

The `ISwapRouter` interface allows interaction with a Uniswap V2-compatible router:

- `swapExactTokensForTokens`: Swaps an exact amount of input tokens.
- `getAmountsIn`: Calculates how much input is needed for a given output.

### 3. State Variables and Constructor

Defined state variables:

- `router`: Uniswap V2 router contract; in this example, it is the BlazeSwap router.
- `assetManager`: Asset Manager handling FXRP redemption.
- `token`: Token to swap (WCFLR in the swap path).
- `swapPath`: Array of addresses defining the swap route (e.g., WCFLR → FXRP).

To instantiate the contract, the constructor sets up the Uniswap router, FAssets asset manager, and swap path.
It initializes the token as the first token in the swap path.

### 4. Main Function: `swapAndRedeem`

The `swapAndRedeem` is the core function that executes the swap and redemption flow.

- **1. Validation**
  - Ensure the caller has sufficient WCFLR balance.
  - Confirm the contract has enough FXRP allowance for redemption.

- **2. Transfer**
  - Move WCFLR from the caller to the contract.
  - Approve the router to spend WCFLR on behalf of the contract.

- **3. Swap**
  - Perform the swap from WCFLR to FXRP using the specified swap path.
  - Apply a 10-minute deadline for the swap operation.

- **4. Redemption**
  - Redeem the obtained FXRP through the FAssets system.
  - Transfer the resulting XRP to the caller's XRPL address.

- **5. Helper Function: `calculateRedemptionAmountIn`**
  - Accept the number of FXRP lots intended for redemption.
  - Fetch the lot size from the FAssets asset manager and calculate the WCFLR needed for swap and redemption.

### 5. Helper Function: `calculateRedemptionAmountIn`

This function calculates the amount of WCFLR needed to swap to FXRP and redeem.

### 6. Helper Function: `_redeem`

- Redeem the obtained FXRP through the FAssets system.
- Transfer the resulting XRP to the caller's XRPL address.

## Execute the Swap and Redeem

To execute the swap and redeem process, you need to deploy the smart contract instance and call the `swapAndRedeem` function.

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="scripts/fassets/swapAndRedeem.ts">
  {FAssetsSwapAndRedeemScript}
</CodeBlock>

### Code Breakdown

- **1. Dependencies and Constants**
  - `LOTS_TO_REDEEM`: The number of FAsset lots to redeem (typically set to 1).
  - `UNDERLYING_ADDRESS`: The XRPL address that will receive the redeemed assets.
  - `SWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS`: The address of the Uniswap V2-compatible swap router.
  - `WC2FLR`: Wrapped CFLR token address.

- **2. Deploy and Verify**
  - Deploys the `SwapAndRedeem` contract and verifies it using [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit).

- **3. Calculate Redemption Amounts**
  - Calls `calculateRedemptionAmountIn` to determine the required WCFLR amount.

- **4. Approve Tokens**
  - Uses the ERC-20 `approve` method to allow the contract to spend WCFLR.
    :::warning
    In a production environment, you should use a secure method to approve spending the tokens.
    :::

- **5. Execute the Swap and Redemption**
  - Calls `swapAndRedeem` to complete the FAssets redemption process.

### Run the Script

To run the script, use the [Flare Hardhat Starter Kit](/network/guides/hardhat-foundry-starter-kit) with the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/fassets/swapAndRedeem.ts --network coston
```

The script outputs transaction details, including swap amounts and redemption results.

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to:

- swap WCFLR for FXRP using Uniswap V2 compatible router (in this example, BlazeSwap);
- redeem FXRP to XRP on the XRP Ledger using FAssets asset manager.
