This guide will help you set up an FTSOv2 data provider. FTSO data providers are responsible for sourcing off-chain data and bringing it to Flare. FTSOv2 consists of two main types of feeds:

- **Block-latency feeds**, protocol code name Fast Updates or `fast-updates`. Updates with every new block on Flare, every ≈1.8 seconds.

- **Anchor feeds**, protocol code name Scaling or `ftso-scaling`. Updates with every new voting round, which each round lasting exactly 90 seconds.

This guide will help you set up both components, note that only the code names will be used in this guide and any repositories referenced.

## Overview

A data provider system for FTSOv2 consists of five components:

- **Feed Value Provider.** Provides the latest values for a given set of feeds.

- **Data Provider.** Provides commit, reveal, and median result data to **Flare System Client** for submission.

- **Flare System Client.** Responsible for all interactions with the FTSOv2 smart contracts, including data collection, submission, voter registration, and other system tasks.

- **Fast Updates Client.** Responsible for interaction with Fast Updates contracts, including data collection, submission and other system tasks.

- **Indexer.** Monitors the blockchain and records all FTSOv2 related transactions and events.

Reference implementations are provided for all five components.

:::warning
The reference implementation of **Feed Value Provider** is only provided for testing purposes and should not be relied on. Data providers are expected to reimplement this with their own data sources.

    ),
  }}
/>

## Operation

A simplified description of a single voting round operation:

**Flare System Client** runs a scheduler which triggers voting actions every round (90s):

- On voting round start, obtain reveal data for the previous round from **Data Provider** and send to `Submission` smart contract.

- Once the reveal deadline passes (45s), obtain median result Merkle root from **Data Provider**, sign, and send to `Submission` smart contract.

- Before the end of the voting round, obtain a feed value commit hash for the current round from the **Data Provider** (which will get processed in the following round).

- There is a finalizer process which monitors the indexer database for signature transactions, and once enough signature weight for a voting round is gathered, submits the set of signatures to the `Relay` smart contract. If signature verification passes, the voting round is considered finalized. The `Relay` contract is the authoritative storage of confirmed voting round result Merkle roots.

Additionally, once in a reward epoch the **System Client** triggers voter registration, which allows participating in the following reward epoch.

**Data Provider** obtains all commit and reveal data straight from encoded transaction calldata recorded in the indexer database. All calls to `Submission` contract are simply empty function invocations, with the actual submission data provided as additional calldata in the transaction.

## Registration

:::note
Account registration with the `EntityManager` contract is required for FTSOv2 participation, and must be done before starting any further deployment steps.
:::

Each data provider in the FTSOv2 system must set up and register the following five accounts:

- `Identity`. Main identity account of the voter. On mainnet this should be held in cold storage. This account is required for initial data provider setup, but is not used during each voting round.

- `Submit`. Used for sending commit and reveal transactions.

- `SubmitSignatures`. Used for sending voting round result signature transactions. (To avoid nonce conflicts, **Flare System Client** uses multiple accounts for submitting transactions).

- `SigningPolicy`. Used for signature generation during the voting round, and reward epoch signing policy signing (it's a system protocol ran once during reward epoch to establish reward epoch settings, including valid voters and their weights).

- `Delegation`. Account to which community should delegate funds (using WNat contract) to increase the vote power of the voter (identity/entity) - and also to later get the rewards. If not set, the identity account will be used.

Accounts need to be funded for gas fees. The delegation account is used of establishing voter power, which can be achieved by wrapping funds directly or by delegation from other accounts. Wrapping can be done via the [development portal](https://governance.dev.aflabs.org/) (make sure to pick the correct network for testnets) and via [portal](https://portal.flare.network) for mainnet.

:::warning
Protocol operation uses normalized weights, and the delegation account should have **at least 150 WCFLR** to obtain a non-zero vote power.
:::

### Generate sortition key

Generate a sortition key to use in Fast Updates, read more about this in [flare-foundation/fast-updates](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fast-updates/tree/main/go-client). You can use the provided docker image to generate a key:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/flare-foundation/fast-updates/go-client:latest keygen
```

Accounts for submission need to be generated and funded with gas fees. These can be any accounts **not used** for the five accounts above and don't need to be registered with the system. We suggest using three accounts to avoid nonce conflicts. You will need to pass their private keys in the `.env` file defined ahead in [Configure environment](#configure-environment).

### Using the contract

Account registration is handled by the `EntityManager` smart contract:

- [EntityManager Coston](https://coston-explorer.flare.network/address/0x60A848E5Da796D741e559c170E851FC813061217/write-contract#address-tabs)
- [EntityManager Songbird](https://songbird-explorer.flare.network/address/0x46C417D0760198E94fee455CE0e223262a3D0049/write-contract#address-tabs)

The required contract invocation steps can be found in the [register-entities.ts](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/blob/main/deployment/tasks/register-entities.ts#L33) deployment task. You can checkout the repo and run the task, or register accounts manually via the explorer UI linked above. Registration only needs to be done once.

### Using Hardhat

Clone and build [flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/
cd flare-smart-contracts-v2
yarn
yarn c
```

Create a JSON file with account addresses and keys

```json title="entities.json"
[
  {
      "identity": {
        "address": "0xca84d6086c5b32212a0cf1638803355d7be31482",
        "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
      },
      "submit": {
        "address": "0x7961de7ad159106a79187379a22d21c1e5a924db",
        "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
      },
      "submitSignatures": {
        "address": "0x7570c09c17f79aa50bab7ba385c0d5ca12c5b4d3",
        "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
      },
      "signingPolicy": {
        "address": "0x9ffa9cf5f677e925b6ecacbf66caefd7e1b9883a",
        "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
      },
      "delegation": {
        "address": "0x95288e962ff1893ef6c32ad4143fffb12e1eb15f",
        "privateKey": "<private key hex>"
      }
      "sortitionPrivateKey": "<private key hex>"
  }
]
```

Setup the following variables in `.env`

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="coston" label="Coston" default>

```text title=".env"
ENTITIES_FILE_PATH="<path to entities.json>"
COSTON_RPC=<non-public Coston RPC>
CHAIN_CONFIG="coston"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="coston2" label="Coston2">

```text title=".env"
ENTITIES_FILE_PATH="<path to entities.json>"
COSTON2_RPC=<non-public Coston2 RPC>
CHAIN_CONFIG="coston2"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="songbird" label="Songbird">

```text title=".env"
ENTITIES_FILE_PATH="<path to entities.json>"
SONGBIRD_RPC=<non-public Songbird RPC>
CHAIN_CONFIG="songbird"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning

- Do not use `.env.template`, instead just create a `.env` using the above example, otherwise the running tasks will fail.
- Do not use public RPCs, you will get rate limited.
  :::

Run registration tasks

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="coston" label="Coston" default>

</Tabs>

## Setup

### Install dependencies

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS" default>
    ```bash 
    brew install jq gettext bash
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">
    ```bash 
    apt install jq
    ```
    
  </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="arch" label="Arch">
    ```bash
    pacman -S jq
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Clone the repository

Clone [flare-foundation/ftso-v2-provider-deployment](https://github.com/flare-foundation/ftso-v2-provider-deployment.git)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/ftso-v2-provider-deployment.git
cd ftso-v2-provider-deployment
```

### Configure environment

Use `.env.example` to create a `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the following variables in `.env`:

- Private keys for required accounts.
- `NETWORK` to `coston` `coston2` or `songbird`.
- `NODE_RPC_URL` and `NODE_API_KEY` (optional) with your Coston or Songbird node RPC endpoint.
- `VALUE_PROVIDER_URL` to the endpoint of your feed value provider. Leave default if using the example provider for testing.
- `FAST_UPDATES_ACCOUNTS` for the private keys of fast updates submission accounts separated by commas.
- `FAST_UPDATES_SORTITION_PRIVATE_KEY` to the key that was registered with the network

Populate the provider stack config:

```bash
chmod +x populate_config.sh
./populate_config.sh
```

:::note
You will need to re-run this command if you modify your `.env` file.
:::

## Deployment

### Start provider stack

Since the `docker-compose.yaml` is already provided you can start everything with `docker compose up -d`
and stop everything with `docker compose down`. Database is persisted in a named docker volume.
If you need to wipe the database you will need to remove the volume manually. When codebase is changed
new images need to be pulled with `docker compose pull`

### Feed value provider

Start your own feed value provider, or (for testing only) use the example test provider:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --publish "0.0.0.0:3101:3101" --network "ftso-v2-deployment_default" ghcr.io/flare-foundation/ftso-v2-example-value-provider
```

Once the container is running, you can find the API spec at: http://localhost:3101/api-doc

:::note
Some users reported issues with getting the example test provider to start. For initial testing a "fixed" value provider can be used that simply returns a constant instead of reading data from external data sources. It can be started by setting an extra env variable `VALUE_PROVIDER_IMPL=fixed`:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --env VALUE_PROVIDER_IMPL=fixed --publish "0.0.0.0:3101:3101" --network "ftso-v2-deployment_default" ghcr.io/flare-foundation/ftso-v2-example-value-provider
```

You should see the following in the logs:

```log
WARN [FixedFeed] Initializing FixedFeed, will return 0.01 for all feeds.
```

:::

## Is it working?

You will see various errors initially on `ftso-scaling` and `flare-system-client`, since the data provider will not be registered as a voter for the current reward epoch. There is a time window for voter registration on every reward epoch, and if you leave things running you should eventually see `RegisterVoter success` logged by `flare-system-client`. It should then start submitting data successfully in the **following** reward epoch.
