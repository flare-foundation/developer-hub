**Flare is the blockchain for data ☀️**, offering developers and users secure, decentralized access to high-integrity data from other chains and the internet. Flare's Layer-1 network uniquely supports enshrined data protocols at the network layer, making it the only EVM-compatible smart contract platform optimized for decentralized data acquisition, including price and time-series data, blockchain event and state data, and Web2 API data.

By providing broad data access at scale and minimal cost, Flare delivers a full-stack solution for building the next generation of secure, interoperable, and data-driven decentralized applications.

## Getting started

- [Hello World in your browser](/network/getting-started) — Build and deploy your first smart contract on Flare, using only your browser.

- [Learn how to use FTSOv2](/ftso/overview) — Leverage the latest upgrades to the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO), with feeds now updating every ≈1.8 seconds.

- Start building on Flare with programming languages you may already know

  - [JavaScript](/network/guides/flare-for-javascript-developers)
  - [Python](/network/guides/flare-for-python-developers)
  - [Rust](/network/guides/flare-for-rust-developers)
  - [Go](/network/guides/flare-for-go-developers)

## Understand the architecture

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that set Flare apart from other blockchains. Flare's data protocols, [Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO)](/ftso/overview) and [Flare Data Connector (FDC)](/fdc/overview), are enshrined into the core protocol of Flare, and inherit the economic security of the entire network.
