Running your own node is the most direct way to connect to and interact with the Flare network.
Whether you need to query blockchain data for your application, want to help secure the network by validating transactions, or aim to participate fully in Flare's data protocols, setting up a node is the first step.

This guide covers the different types of nodes you can run - RPC, Validator, and Flare Entity - and provides links to detailed setup instructions for each.

## RPC Node

Allows applications to read blockchain data and submit transactions.
Does not participate in consensus.

      label: "Run Node using Docker",
      href: "run-node/using-docker",

    },
  ]}
/>

## Validator Node

Secures the network by validating transactions and participating in consensus.
Setting up a validator starts with installing a standard node (see [RPC Node](#rpc-node)).
Once your node is running, proceed with the registration:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "Register as Validator",
      href: "run-node/register-validator",
      description: "Register your node as a validator.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Flare Entity

Runs alongside a Validator to provide crucial data for Flare's FTSO and FDC protocols.
Required for full reward eligibility.
Requires a running [Validator Node](#validator-node). To set up a Flare Entity:

<DocCardList
  items={[
    {
      type: "link",
      label: "Set Up Flare Entity",
      href: "run-node/flare-entity",
      description: "Provide data for Flare's enshrined FTSO and FDC protocols.",
    },
  ]}
/>

All registered Flare Entities, alongside voting and reward epoch, and finalization data can be viewed on the [Flare Systems Explorer](https://flare-systems-explorer.flare.network/providers).
