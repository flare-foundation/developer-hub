The FDC provider deployment is now integrated into the [`flare-systems-deployment`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-systems-deployment) repository, which also supports FTSO provider deployments.
In addition, FDC also requires the [`fdc-suite-deployment`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fdc-suite-deployment) for verifiers and nodes.
