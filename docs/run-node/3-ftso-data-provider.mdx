:::info

The FTSO Provider deployment is now integrated into the [`flare-systems-deployment`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-systems-deployment) repository, which also supports FDC deployments. Previously, deployments were managed through the `ftso-v2-provider-deployment` repository.

The older repository is being deprecated. While it remains available for legacy deployments on Flare or Songbird, transitioning to the updated repository is strongly recommended. Active development has shifted to the new repository, where all future updates and features will be introduced. You can find the deprecation notice and detailed upgrade instructions [here](https://github.com/flare-foundation/ftso-v2-provider-deployment/tree/0.3.1-deprecation.2) until the information is merged into the official repository.

For additional information and updates, please follow us on the [Flare forum](https://forum.flare.network/).
