:::info

The FDC Provider deployment is now integrated into the [`flare-systems-deployment`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-systems-deployment) repository, which also supports FTSO deployments. Previously, deployments were managed through the `ftso-v2-provider-deployment` repository.

The older repository is being deprecated. While it remains available for legacy deployments on Flare or Songbird, transitioning to the updated repository is strongly recommended. Active development has shifted to the new repository, where all future updates and features will be introduced. You can find the deprecation notice and detailed upgrade instructions [here](https://github.com/flare-foundation/ftso-v2-provider-deployment/tree/0.3.1-deprecation.2) until the information is merged into the official repository.

To run the FDC Client, you must also deploy verifiers and nodes that the client depends on. The [`fdc-suite-deployment`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fdc-suite-deployment) repository contains comprehensive instructions for setting up and deploying these components.

If you already operate some of the required nodes, you can connect the FDC Client to those existing nodes, ensuring that the configurations remain compatible to avoid any operational issues.
