:::info

FDC client deploy is part of [`flare-systems-deployment`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-systems-deployment) repo that you also use for ftso v2 deploy (before it was called `ftso-v2-provider-deployment`).

The old repo is getting discontinued, but you can still use it in the old deployments for flare/songbird, but are encouraged to move to the newer version.
The development has moved to the newer version and any new features will be added there.
View the deprecation notice and upgrade instructions [here](https://github.com/flare-foundation/ftso-v2-provider-deployment/tree/0.3.1-deprecation.2) until it is merged in the official repo.

Apart from running the FDC client, you also need to run verifiers and nodes that the FDC client will use.
The verifier and node deployment [repo](https://github.com/flare-foundation/fdc-suite-deployment) contains all the instructions on how to set up and deploy them.
If you are already running some of the required nodes, you can connect to existing ones (but be careful about the specific configurations).
