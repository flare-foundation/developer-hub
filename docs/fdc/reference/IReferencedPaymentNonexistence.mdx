An interface to verify that a specific payment, agreed to be completed by a certain deadline, has **not been made** on an external blockchain.

Sourced from `IReferencedPaymentNonexistence.sol` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/fdc/IReferencedPaymentNonexistence.sol).

## Overview

The IReferencedPaymentNonexistence interface enables smart contracts on Flare networks to verify the absence of specific payment transactions on external blockchains. This type of attestation is particularly useful for conditional agreements where the absence of a payment by a deadline triggers consequences, such as liquidating collateral or executing penalties in cross-chain financial arrangements.

## Supported Chains

| Network Type | Supported Chains                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mainnet**  | `BTC` (Bitcoin), `DOGE` (Dogecoin), `XRP` (XRP Ledger) |
| **Testnet**  | `testBTC` (Bitcoin Testnet v3), `testDOGE`, `testXRP`  |

## Chain-Specific Verification Criteria

### UTXO Chains (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)

A transaction is considered a match (and would invalidate the nonexistence claim) if all of the following are true:

- It is **not** a coinbase transaction
- The transaction includes the specified standard payment reference
- If `checkSourceAddresses` is true, the source addresses root matches the specified one
- The sum of outputs to the destination address, minus any inputs from that address, exceeds the specified amount
- The transaction appears within the specified block range

### Account-based Chains (XRPL)

A transaction is considered a match (and would invalidate the nonexistence claim) if all of the following are true:

- The transaction is of type "Payment"
- The transaction includes the specified standard payment reference
- If `checkSourceAddresses` is true, the source addresses root matches the specified one
- One of the following conditions is met:
  - Transaction status is "SUCCESS" and the amount received by the destination address exceeds the specified amount
  - Transaction status is "RECEIVER_FAILURE" and the amount that would have been received exceeds the specified amount
- The transaction appears within the specified block range

 * @notice Assertion that an agreed-upon payment has not been made by a certain deadline.
 * A confirmed request shows that a transaction meeting certain criteria (address, amount, reference)
 * did not appear in the specified block range.
 *
 *
 * This type of attestation can be used to e.g. provide grounds to liquidate funds locked by a smart

 *
 * @custom:verification If `firstOverflowBlock` cannot be determined or does not have a sufficient
 * number of confirmations, the attestation request is rejected.
 * If `firstOverflowBlockNumber` is higher or equal to `minimalBlockNumber`, the request is rejected.
 * The search range are blocks between heights including `minimalBlockNumber` and excluding `firstOverflowBlockNumber`.
 * If the verifier does not have a view of all blocks from `minimalBlockNumber` to `firstOverflowBlockNumber`,
 * the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * The request is confirmed if no transaction meeting the specified criteria is found in the search range.
 * The criteria and timestamp are chain specific.
 * ### UTXO (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)
 *
 *
 * Criteria for the transaction:
 *
 *
 * - It is not coinbase transaction.
 * - The transaction has the specified standardPaymentReference.
 * - The sum of values of all outputs with the specified address minus the sum of values of all inputs with
 * the specified address is greater than `amount` (in practice the sum of all values of the inputs with the
 * specified address is zero).
 *
 *
 * Timestamp is `mediantime`.
 * ### XRPL
 *
 *
 *
 * Criteria for the transaction:
 * - The transaction is of type payment.
 * - The transaction has the specified standardPaymentReference,
 * - One of the following is true:
 *   - Transaction status is `SUCCESS` and the amount received by the specified destination address is
 * greater than the specified `value`.
 *   - Transaction status is `RECEIVER_FAILURE` and the specified destination address would receive an
 * amount greater than the specified `value` had the transaction been successful.
 *
 *
 * Timestamp is `close_time` converted to UNIX time.

## Structs

### Request

Toplevel request structure.

#### Parameters

- `attestationType`: ID of the attestation type (0x04 for ReferencedPaymentNonexistence)
- `sourceId`: ID of the data source (e.g., BTC, DOGE, XRP)
- `messageIntegrityCode`: MessageIntegrityCode derived from the expected response
- `requestBody`: Data defining the request

### Response

Toplevel response structure.

#### Parameters

- `attestationType`: Extracted from the request
- `sourceId`: Extracted from the request
- `votingRound`: The ID of the FDC round in which the request was considered
- `lowestUsedTimestamp`: The lowest timestamp used to generate the response
- `requestBody`: Extracted from the request
- `responseBody`: Data defining the response

### Proof

Toplevel proof structure for verification.

#### Parameters

- `merkleProof`: Merkle proof corresponding to the attestation response
- `data`: Attestation response

### RequestBody

Request body specific to payment nonexistence verification.

#### Parameters

- `minimalBlockNumber`: The starting block number of the search range
- `deadlineBlockNumber`: The last block number to include in the search range
- `deadlineTimestamp`: The timestamp deadline for the payment
- `destinationAddressHash`: Standard hash of the address that should have received the payment
- `amount`: Minimum amount that should have been received
- `standardPaymentReference`: The specific payment reference that should have been included
- `checkSourceAddresses`: If true, source addresses are also verified
- `sourceAddressesRoot`: Merkle tree root of expected source addresses (if checked)

### ResponseBody

Response body containing search range details.

#### Parameters

- `minimalBlockTimestamp`: Timestamp of the first block in the search range
- `firstOverflowBlockNumber`: Block number of the first block after the deadline
- `firstOverflowBlockTimestamp`: Timestamp of the first block after the deadline

## Block Range Definition

The search range for payment verification is defined as:

- **Start**: Block at `minimalBlockNumber` (inclusive)
- **End**: Block at `firstOverflowBlockNumber` (exclusive)

The `firstOverflowBlock` is determined as the first block that:

1. Has a block number greater than `deadlineBlockNumber`
2. Has a timestamp later than `deadlineTimestamp`

This dual condition approach ensures that both block height and timestamp requirements are met.

## Implementation Notes

- Attestation ID: `0x04`
- The `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter uses the value of `minimalBlockTimestamp`
- The `lutlimit` (Lowest Used Timestamp limit) is `0x127500` (1,209,600 seconds = 14 days) for all supported chains
- The standard payment reference must not be zero
- Request will be rejected if the verification node doesn't have visibility of all blocks in the search range
- Request will be rejected if `firstOverflowBlockNumber` cannot be determined or lacks sufficient confirmations

## Standard Payment Reference

A standardized payment reference follows a specific format to ensure consistency across different blockchains:

- For UTXO chains (BTC, DOGE): Derived from OP_RETURN outputs or specific patterns in transaction data
- For XRPL: Derived from the MemoData field in the transaction

The standardPaymentReference is critical for this attestation type as it uniquely identifies the specific payment being verified for nonexistence.
