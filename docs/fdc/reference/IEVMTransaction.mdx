An interface to relay and verify transactions from EVM-compatible blockchains.

Sourced from `IEVMTransaction.sol` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/fdc/IEVMTransaction.sol).

## Overview

The IEVMTransaction interface enables smart contracts on Flare networks to access and verify transaction data from other EVM-compatible blockchains. This attestation type provides access to transaction details, including associated events (logs), allowing cross-chain verification and integration of data from external EVM chains.

## Supported Chains

| Network Type | Supported Chains                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mainnet**  | `ETH` (Ethereum), `FLR` (Flare), `SGB` (Songbird)                                                    |
| **Testnet**  | `testETH` (Ethereum Sepolia), `testFLR` (Flare Testnet Coston2), `testSGB` (Songbird Testnet Coston) |

## Structs

### Request

Toplevel request structure.

#### Parameters

- `attestationType`: ID of the attestation type (0x06 for EVMTransaction)
- `sourceId`: ID of the data source (e.g., ETH, FLR, SGB)
- `messageIntegrityCode`: MessageIntegrityCode derived from the expected response
- `requestBody`: Data defining the request

### Response

Toplevel response structure.

#### Parameters

- `attestationType`: Extracted from the request
- `sourceId`: Extracted from the request
- `votingRound`: The ID of the State Connector round in which the request was considered
- `lowestUsedTimestamp`: The lowest timestamp used to generate the response
- `requestBody`: Extracted from the request
- `responseBody`: Data defining the response

### Proof

Toplevel proof structure for verification.

#### Parameters

- `merkleProof`: Merkle proof corresponding to the attestation response
- `data`: Attestation response

### RequestBody

Request body specific to EVM transaction verification.

#### Parameters

- `transactionHash`: The hash of the transaction to relay
- `requiredConfirmations`: Number of confirmations required for the block to be considered final
- `provideInput`: If true, the transaction input data will be included in the response
- `listEvents`: If true, events specified by logIndices will be included in the response
- `logIndices`: Array of event indices to be relayed (max 50), if empty and listEvents is true, includes all events up to 50

### ResponseBody

Response body containing transaction details.

#### Parameters

- `blockNumber`: Block number containing the transaction
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of the block containing the transaction
- `sourceAddress`: Address that signed the transaction (from)
- `isDeployment`: True if the transaction created a contract
- `receivingAddress`: Address receiving the transaction (to), zero address if isDeployment is true
- `value`: Value transferred in wei
- `input`: Transaction input data if provideInput is true, otherwise "0x00"
- `status`: Transaction status (1 = success, 0 = failure)
- `events`: Array of requested events if listEvents is true, otherwise empty

### Event

Structure representing a transaction event (log).

#### Parameters

- `logIndex`: Index of the event within the block
- `emitterAddress`: Contract address that emitted the event
- `topics`: Array of indexed event parameters (up to 4)
- `data`: Non-indexed event parameters, concatenated as 32-byte strings
- `removed`: True if the event was removed due to a chain reorganization

## Implementation Notes

- Attestation ID: `0x06`
- The `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter uses the value of `timestamp`
- The `lutlimit` (Lowest Used Timestamp limit) is `0x41eb00` (4,300,800 seconds = ~50 days) for all supported chains
- Events are indexed at the block level, not at the transaction level
- Maximum of 50 events can be included in a single attestation

## Event Handling

When working with events, it's important to remember:

1. Events (logs) are indexed at the **block level**, not at the transaction level
2. The order of events in `logIndices` should follow the requirements of the consuming contract
3. If `listEvents` is set to false, `logIndices` must be an empty array
4. If `listEvents` is true but `logIndices` is empty, all events up to a maximum of 50 will be included
5. Events are returned in the same order as specified in `logIndices`
