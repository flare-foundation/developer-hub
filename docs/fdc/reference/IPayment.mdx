description: Relay a transaction in native currency.
---

An interface to relay and verify payment transactions in native currencies across multiple external blockchains.

Sourced from `IPayment.sol` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/fdc/IPayment.sol).

## Overview

The IPayment interface enables smart contracts on Flare networks to access and verify native currency payment transactions from external blockchains. It provides a standardized way to prove that payments have occurred between entities, similar to traditional banking transfers, with support for payment references. This attestation type handles the different transaction models across various blockchains, offering a unified interface for payment verification.

## Supported Chains

| Network Type | Supported Chains                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mainnet**  | `BTC` (Bitcoin), `DOGE` (Dogecoin), `XRP` (XRP Ledger) |
| **Testnet**  | `testBTC` (Bitcoin Testnet v3), `testDOGE`, `testXRP`  |

## Chain-Specific Implementation Details

### UTXO Chains (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)

- **Transaction Model**: Uses inputs and outputs, where multiple addresses can contribute inputs and receive outputs
- **inUtxo**: Index of the transaction input with the source address
- **utxo**: Index of the transaction output with the receiving address
- **blockTimestamp**: Derived from the mediantime of the block

### Account-based Chains (XRPL)

- **Transaction Model**: Direct transfers between accounts
- **inUtxo** and **utxo**: Always set to 0 (not used)
- **blockTimestamp**: Derived from the close_time of the ledger converted to UNIX time

 * @author Flare
 * @notice A relay of a transaction on an external chain that is considered a payment in a native currency.
 * Various blockchains support different types of native payments. For each blockchain, it is specified how a payment
 * transaction should be formed to be provable by this attestation type.
 * The provable payments emulate traditional banking payments from entity A to entity B in native currency with an
 * optional payment reference.
 * @custom:verification The transaction with `transactionId` is fetched from the API of the blockchain node or
 * relevant indexer.
 * If the transaction cannot be fetched or the transaction is in a block that does not have a sufficient
 * [number of confirmations](/specs/attestations/configs.md#finalityconfirmation), the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * Once the transaction is received, the payment summary is computed according to the rules for the source chain.
 * If the summary is successfully calculated, the response is assembled from the summary.
 * `blockNumber` and `blockTimestamp` are retrieved from the block if they are not included in the transaction data.
 * For Bitcoin and Dogecoin, `blockTimestamp` is mediantime of the block.
 * For XRPL, `blockTimestamp` is close time of the ledger converted to UNIX time.
 *
 * If the summary is not successfully calculated, the attestation request is rejected.
 * @custom:lut `blockTimestamp`
 * @custom:lutlimit `0x127500`, `0x127500`, `0x127500`

### ResponseBody

Response body containing payment transaction details.

#### Parameters

## Transaction Status Codes

| Status Code | Description      | Explanation                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0           | SUCCESS          | Transaction completed successfully                      |
| 1           | SENDER_FAILURE   | Transaction failed due to issues on the sender's side   |
| 2           | RECEIVER_FAILURE | Transaction failed due to issues on the receiver's side |

## Implementation Notes

- Attestation ID: `0x01`
- The `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter uses the value of `blockTimestamp`
- The `lutlimit` (Lowest Used Timestamp limit) is `0x127500` (1,209,600 seconds = 14 days) for all supported chains
- Standard payment references can be included for cross-chain payment identification
- For account-based chains like XRPL, `inUtxo` and `utxo` parameters should be set to 0
- The `sourceAddressesRoot` is a Merkle tree root of all transaction input addresses, useful for multi-input transactions
- The `oneToOne` flag helps identify simple peer-to-peer transfers versus more complex multi-party transactions

## Standard Payment Reference

A standardized payment reference follows a specific format to ensure consistency across different blockchains:

- For UTXO chains (BTC, DOGE): Derived from OP_RETURN outputs or specific patterns in transaction data
- For XRPL: Derived from the MemoData field in the transaction

Payment references allow for correlation of payments across chains and facilitate payment reconciliation in cross-chain applications.
