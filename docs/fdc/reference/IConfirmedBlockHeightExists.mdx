An interface to verify that a specified block has been confirmed on an external blockchain and to calculate block production rates.

Sourced from `IConfirmedBlockHeightExists.sol` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/fdc/IConfirmedBlockHeightExists.sol).

## Overview

The IConfirmedBlockHeightExists interface allows smart contracts to verify that a specific block number exists and has reached the required confirmation threshold on an external blockchain. Additionally, it provides data to calculate block production rates over a specified time window, which can be useful for estimating transaction finality times or implementing time-dependent logic.

## Structs

### Request

Toplevel request structure.

#### Parameters

- `attestationType`: ID of the attestation type (0x02 for ConfirmedBlockHeightExists)
- `sourceId`: ID of the data source (e.g., BTC, DOGE, XRP)
- `messageIntegrityCode`: MessageIntegrityCode derived from the expected response
- `requestBody`: Data defining the request

### Response

Toplevel response structure.

#### Parameters

- `attestationType`: Extracted from the request
- `sourceId`: Extracted from the request
- `votingRound`: The ID of the State Connector round in which the request was considered
- `lowestUsedTimestamp`: The lowest timestamp used to generate the response
- `requestBody`: Extracted from the request
- `responseBody`: Data defining the response

### Proof

Toplevel proof structure for verification.

#### Parameters

- `merkleProof`: Merkle proof corresponding to the attestation response
- `data`: Attestation response

### RequestBody

Request body specific to block height confirmation.

#### Parameters

- `blockNumber`: The number of the block to confirm
- `queryWindow`: Time period in seconds to calculate block production rate

### ResponseBody

Response body specific to block height confirmation.

#### Parameters

- `blockTimestamp`: Timestamp of the block with `blockNumber`
- `numberOfConfirmations`: Required confirmations for the specific chain
- `lowestQueryWindowBlockNumber`: Block number of the latest block with timestamp < `blockTimestamp - queryWindow`
- `lowestQueryWindowBlockTimestamp`: Timestamp of the block at `lowestQueryWindowBlockNumber`

## Implementation Notes

- Attestation ID: `0x02`
- Timestamp values vary by chain (mediantime for BTC/DOGE, close_time for XRP)
- The `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter uses the value of `lowestQueryWindowBlockTimestamp`
- The `lutlimit` (Lowest Used Timestamp limit) is `0x127500` (1,209,600 seconds = 14 days) for all supported chains

## Calculating Block Production Rate

The response fields allow developers to calculate the average block production rate using the formula:

```
blocks_produced = blockNumber - lowestQueryWindowBlockNumber
time_elapsed = blockTimestamp - lowestQueryWindowBlockTimestamp
average_block_time = time_elapsed / blocks_produced
```
