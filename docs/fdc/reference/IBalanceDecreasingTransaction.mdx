description: Detect a transaction that decreases an address balance.
---

An interface to detect transactions that decrease the balance of a specific address or are signed by that address on external blockchains.

Sourced from `IBalanceDecreasingTransaction.sol` on [GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-smart-contracts-v2/blob/main/contracts/userInterfaces/fdc/IBalanceDecreasingTransaction.sol).

## Overview

The IBalanceDecreasingTransaction interface allows smart contracts to identify and verify transactions on external blockchains that either:

1. Decrease the balance of a specific address, or
2. Are signed by the address in question (even if the balance increases)

This attestation type is particularly useful for detecting when a party has violated an agreement by moving funds that were promised to be locked, providing grounds for liquidating collateral locked in a smart contract on Flare.

## Supported Chains

| Network Type | Supported Chains                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mainnet**  | `BTC` (Bitcoin), `DOGE` (Dogecoin), `XRP` (XRP Ledger) |
| **Testnet**  | `testBTC` (Bitcoin Testnet v3), `testDOGE`, `testXRP`  |

## Chain-Specific Implementation Details

### UTXO Chains (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)

- **sourceAddressIndicator**: Index of the transaction input in hex padded to a 0x-prefixed 32-byte string
- **sourceAddress**: Address of the indicated transaction input
- **spentAmount**: Sum of values of all inputs with sourceAddress minus sum of all outputs with sourceAddress (can be negative)
- **blockTimestamp**: Mediantime of the block

### Account-based Chains (XRPL)

- **sourceAddressIndicator**: Standard address hash of the address to monitor
- **sourceAddress**: Address whose standard hash matches the sourceAddressIndicator
- **spentAmount**: Difference between the balance after and before the transaction (can be negative)
- **blockTimestamp**: close_time of the ledger converted to Unix time

/**
 * @custom:name IBalanceDecreasingTransaction
 * @custom:id 0x02
 * @custom:supported BTC, DOGE, XRP
 * @author Flare
 * @notice A detection of a transaction that either decreases the balance for some address or is
 * signed by the source address.
 * Such an attestation could prove a violation of an agreement and therefore provides grounds to liquidate
 * some funds locked by a smart contract on Flare.
 *
 * A transaction is considered "balance decreasing" for the address, if the balance after the
 * transaction is lower than before or the address is among the signers of the transaction
 * (even if its balance is greater than before the transaction).
 * @custom:verification The transaction with `transactionId` is fetched from the API of the
 * source blockchain node or relevant indexer.
 * If the transaction cannot be fetched or the transaction is in a block that does not have a
 * sufficient number of confirmations, the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * Once the transaction is received, the response fields are extracted if the transaction is balance
 * decreasing for the indicated address.
 * Some of the request and response fields are chain specific as described below.
 * The fields can be computed with the help of a balance decreasing summary.
 *
 * ### UTXO (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)
 *
 * - `sourceAddressIndicator` is the the index of the transaction input in hex padded to a 0x prefixed 32-byte string.
 * If the indicated input does not exist or the indicated input does not have the address,
 * the attestation request is rejected.
 * The `sourceAddress` is the address of the indicated transaction input.
 * - `spentAmount` is the sum of values of all inputs with sourceAddress minus the sum of
 * all outputs with `sourceAddress`.
 * Can be negative.
 * - `blockTimestamp` is the mediantime of a block.
 *
 * ### XRPL
 *
 * - `sourceAddressIndicator` is the standard address hash of the address whose balance has been decreased.
 * If the address indicated by `sourceAddressIndicator` is not among the signers of the transaction and the balance
 * of the address was not lowered in the transaction, the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * - `spentAmount` is the difference between the balance of the indicated address after and before the transaction.
 * Can be negative.
 * - `blockTimestamp` is the close_time of a ledger converted to unix time.

## Structs

### Request

Toplevel request structure.

#### Parameters

- `attestationType`: ID of the attestation type (0x02 for BalanceDecreasingTransaction)
- `sourceId`: ID of the data source (e.g., BTC, DOGE, XRP)
- `messageIntegrityCode`: MessageIntegrityCode derived from the expected response
- `requestBody`: Data defining the request

### Response

Toplevel response structure.

#### Parameters

- `attestationType`: Extracted from the request
- `sourceId`: Extracted from the request
- `votingRound`: The ID of the State Connector round in which the request was considered
- `lowestUsedTimestamp`: The lowest timestamp used to generate the response
- `requestBody`: Extracted from the request
- `responseBody`: Data defining the response

### Proof

Toplevel proof structure for verification.

#### Parameters

- `merkleProof`: Merkle proof corresponding to the attestation response
- `data`: Attestation response

### RequestBody

Request body specific to balance decreasing transactions.

#### Parameters

- `transactionId`: Unique identifier of the transaction to check
- `sourceAddressIndicator`: Indicator of the address to monitor (interpretation varies by chain)

### ResponseBody

Response body containing details about the balance decreasing transaction.

#### Parameters

- `blockNumber`: Block number containing the transaction
- `blockTimestamp`: Timestamp of the block containing the transaction
- `sourceAddressHash`: Standard hash of the address indicated by sourceAddressIndicator
- `spentAmount`: Amount spent by the source address (can be negative)
- `standardPaymentReference`: Standard payment reference of the transaction

## Implementation Notes

- Attestation ID: `0x02`
- The `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter uses the value of `blockTimestamp`
- The `lutlimit` (Lowest Used Timestamp limit) is `0x127500` (1,209,600 seconds = 14 days) for all supported chains
- A negative `spentAmount` value indicates the address received more funds than it sent
- The transaction is still considered "balance decreasing" if the address signed the transaction, even if the balance increased

## Practical Applications

- **Cross-chain Collateral Monitoring**: Detect when funds that should be locked on one chain are moved, triggering liquidation of collateral on Flare
- **Agreement Enforcement**: Verify if parties adhere to contractual agreements involving locking funds
- **Fraud Detection**: Monitor specific addresses for suspicious outgoing transactions
- **Conditional Smart Contracts**: Trigger contract actions based on external chain activity
