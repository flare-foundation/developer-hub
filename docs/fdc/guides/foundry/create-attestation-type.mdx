This guide is for developers who want to extend FDC by creating a new attestation type. In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Setup a new attestation type definition in Solidity.

- Generate a attestation type verifier server in TypeScript with controllers and services.

- Create an onchain attestation verifier contract in Solidity.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

## Setup type definition

1. **Clone and setup repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flare-foundation/VerifierServerGenerator.git
   yarn
   ```

2. **Create a definition file:** In the root of the cloned repo a template definition file (`ITypeTemplate.sol.example`) is provided. Rename the file to `ICustomType.sol` and the interface defined within the file to to `ICustomType`. You can use any name in place of `CustomType` upto 32 ASCII characters.

   ```bash
   mkdir contracts/interfaces/types
   cp ICustomType.sol contracts/interfaces/types
   ```

   <details>
     <summary>Definition file template</summary>
     <CodeBlock language="solidity" title="ITypeTemplate.sol.example">
       {ITypeTemplate}
     </CodeBlock>
   </details>

3. **Modify `@custom` props:**

   - `@custom:name`: Rename to `@custom:CustomType`.
   - `@custom:supported`: Indicate the data source, currently supported sources - `BTC`, `DOGE` ,`XRP`, `FLR`, `SGB`, `ETH` and `WEB2`. A single type can support multiple data sources.
   - `@custom:verification`: Add instructions on how to construct a response from the request.
   - `@custom:lut`: Leave as default, this will be used later.

4. **Define request and response structs:** Define the inputs to the `RequestBody` and `ResponseBody` structs. All fields should be commented with `@param fieldName` as in the template.

## Generate verifier server

1. **Generate verifier server template:**

   ```bash
   yarn generate server -t ICustomType
   ```

   :::warning[Overwriting files]

   Any changes made to generated files in `server/ICustomType` are overwritten if you call
   `generate server`.
   :::

2. **Define data sources:**

   - **Single data source:** Change the source in the constructor of `ICustomType.service.ts` to the one specified in the type definition.
     Modify the `verifyRequest` function to match the verification rules defined by your attestation type.

   - **Multiple data sources:** Each source needs its own service and controllers.

     1. **Create services for each source:** In `ICustomType.service.ts` for each source, create a new class, e.g. `<SourceID>ICustomTypeVerifierService`, that implements `verifyRequest` function for the source.

     2. **Create controllers for each source:** In `ICustomType.controller.ts` for each source, create a new class, e.g. `<SourceID>ICustomTypeVerifierController`, and set the type of verifierService to the one created for this type:

        `@ApiTags('ICustomType')` → `@ApiTags('ICustomType', '<sourceID>')`

        `@Controller('ICustomType')` → `@Controller('<sourceID>/ICustomType')`.

     3. **Add services and controllers to module:** In `ICustomType.module.ts`, add all new services and controllers to the respective arrays.

3. **Generate Dockerfile:** Run the following command to create a Dockerfile inside `server/ICustomType/` that prepares the server to be run inside a Docker container.

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

4. **Build server image:** Run the following to build an image for `ICustomType`

   ```bash
   docker build -t library/verifier-indexer-api-CustomType -f server/ICustomType/Dockerfile .
   ```

5. **Start server:** Run the following to start the server and expose port `<PORT>`

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --publish <PORT>:8000  library/verifier-indexer-api-CustomType
   ```

## Create verifier contract

:::warning[In production]

In production use, the verifier contract should validate the response with proof against the Merkle root stored on the [`Relay`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IRelay) contract.

:::

After completing the last steps a mock verification contract is generated with a `verifyCustomType` method that accepts an attestation response with Merkle proof (see the `Proof` struct in `ICustomType.sol`) and always confirms it.
