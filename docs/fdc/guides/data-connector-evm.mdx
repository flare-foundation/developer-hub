The Data Connector bridges the gap between different blockchains, enabling the smooth exchange of information and synchronization of smart contracts and state changes. In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Bridge data across blockchains using the Flare Data Connector.
- Attest to events on EVM chains and use the proof on the Flare Network.

This guide includes code snippets to recreate the process of attesting to a transaction and emitted events on the Ethereum testnet (Sepolia) and using the proof on the Flare Network.

:::info

If you are new to Flare, make sure you understand the [Flare Network](/network/overview) first.

Starter packs for [Hardhat](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter) and [Foundry](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-foundry-starter) are available to help you get started with Flare development.

:::

The Flare Data Connector (FDC) is a protocol on the Flare Network that enables any smart contract on the network to query non-changing, verifiable information from other blockchains.
The protocol is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new blockchains and attestation types in the future.
FDC currently supports Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP Ledger, and their testnet equivalents.
In addition, it also supports chains with smart contract capability, currently Ethereum, Songbird and Flare, together with their testnet equivalents (Sepolia, Coston and Coston2).

The consensus on information from external blockchains is achieved through the BitVote-reveal FDC protocol operating within the Flare Systems Protocol suite.
After the consensus is reached dapps can use the Merkle root to validate and confirm requested data.

## Transferring external data to Flare

This guide focuses on the [**EVMTransaction attestation type**](https://github.com/flare-foundation/songbird-state-connector-protocol/blob/main/specs/attestations/active-types/EVMTransaction.md), an attestation type designed to prove and relay data about a transaction that happened on an external EVM chain.

You will write a simple script and smart contract that will use Flare Data Connector to verify that a transaction happened on the Ethereum network and decode the event log data from the transaction.
You will write a contract that will interact with FDC to verify the provided data, decode and use the event log together with the off-chain script to request the attestation through the FDC and provide proof and data to the contract.

The process of attesting to a transaction on an external chain and using the proof on Flare involves several steps:

1. **Identifying the transaction**

   We need to identify which transaction we want to attest to using the FDC.
   We will use an existing transaction on Sepolia (Ethereum testnet) for this guide that has already been mined and confirmed and contains an event log with data we want to use on Flare.
   In your dapp, you would typically identify the transaction you want to attest to based on some criteria, the one being triggered by a user action or emitting a specific event for example.

2. **Preparing the attestation request**

   Once we have identified the transaction, we need to prepare the attestation request.
   This involves encoding the data about the transaction we want to attest to in a specific format that the FDC can understand.
   This can be done manually, but it is typically done using a verifier service that will provide you with the encoded request.
   We will use the Flare provided verifier service for this guide (Flare provides rate limited verifiers for each supported chain that are fine for development usage, but you should use your own verifier service for production).

3. **Submitting the attestation request**

   Once we have the encoded request, we need to submit it to the FDC.
   This will trigger the FDC to start the attestation process and the FDC consensus protocol.
   Once the consensus is reached, the FDC will store the Merkle root of the attested data on the Flare network.

4. **Extracting the Merkle proof and full data**

   With the Merkle root containing the attestation for requested data stored on the chain, we can now extract the Merkle proof and the full data from the FDC.
   The full data about the transaction will be used by our smart contract logic, while the Merkle proof will be used to verify that the data is included in the Merkle root and is in fact the same data that was attested to.
   To extract the Merkle proof and full data, we will use the publicly available Data Availability (DA) Layer service off-chain and supply this to the smart contract.

5. **Using the data in the smart contract**

   With the Merkle proof and full data extracted, we can now use the data in our smart contract.
   The contract needs to do two things:

   - Verify that the provided transaction data is included in the Merkle root using the Merkle proof (check that the offchain part is not providing false data).
   - Decode the event log data from the transaction and use it in the contract logic.

Let's start

### 1. Identifying the transaction

You can pick any transaction on the Sepolia testnet that has already been mined and confirmed.
We will use [`0x4e636c6590b22d8dcdade7ee3b5ae5572f42edb1878f09b3034b2f7c3362ef3c`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x4e636c6590b22d8dcdade7ee3b5ae5572f42edb1878f09b3034b2f7c3362ef3c) for this guide.
The transaction has already been mined and confirmed and contains an ERC20 `Transfer` event and `Swap` event that are easy to understand and use.

:::note

Data Connector's confirmation requirements are different for each [connected blockchain](https://github.com/flare-foundation/songbird-state-connector-protocol/tree/main/specs/attestations/configs.md).
For EVM chains, we can select the amount of confirmations required for the transaction to be considered confirmed depending on the chain's finality and security guarantees.

:::

:::note
Keep in mind that there is a strict separation between testing and production environments. The Data Connector is configured as follows:

- Songbird Canary-Network and Flare Mainnet: Connected to Bitcoin, Dogecoin, XRP Ledger, Songbird, Flare and Ethereum
- Songbird Testnet Coston and Flare Testnet Coston2: Connected to Bitcoin Testnet, Dogecoin Testnet, XRP Ledger Testnet, Coston Testnet, Coston2 Testnet and Ethereum Sepolia Testnet

On the attestation client and DA Layer side, this typically means a different base URL.
Additionally, you need to specify a different source name `testETH` for the network name instead of `ETH` because the `sourceId` (the network name) is included in the transaction encoding.
The rest of the procedure and the code remains the same.

:::

### 2. Preparing the attestation request

We now need to prepare the attestation request.
This involves encoding the data about the transaction we want to attest to in a specific format that the FDC can understand.
This is done using the verifier server.
You can set up [your own](https://github.com/flare-foundation/attestation-suite-deployment) or use one of the already existing provided.

In this docs, we will use Flare's provided verifier service.
For EVM chains, the main url is `https://fdc-verifiers-testnet.flare.network/` with a nicely formatted swagger interface available at [https://fdc-verifiers-testnet.flare.network/verifier/api-doc](https://fdc-verifiers-testnet.flare.network/verifier/api-doc).

To prepare the request a `prepareRequest` endpoint is used.
The request body is a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "attestationType": "0x45564d5472616e73616374696f6e000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "sourceId": "0x7465737445544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "requestBody": {
    "transactionHash": "0x4e636c6590b22d8dcdade7ee3b5ae5572f42edb1878f09b3034b2f7c3362ef3c",
    "requiredConfirmations": "1",
    "provideInput": true,
    "listEvents": true,
    "logIndices": []
  }
}
```

- `attestationType` is the type of attestation we are requesting.
  In this case, it is `EVMTransaction`.
  We do not supply it as string, but as a hex-encoded string zero padded to 32 bytes - so that it is always the same length and can be easily manipulated in solidity smart contracts.
- `sourceId` is the source chain we are attesting to.
  In this case, it is `testETH`, as we will be attesting to a transaction on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
  Same as with the `attestationType`, it is a hex-encoded string zero padded to 32 bytes.
- `requestBody` contains the data about the transaction we want to attest to.
  - `transactionHash` is the hash of the transaction we want to attest to.
  - `requiredConfirmations` is the number of confirmations required for the transaction to be considered confirmed.
  - `provideInput` is a boolean that specifies if the input data of the toplevel transaction should be included in the response.
  - `listEvents` is a boolean that specifies if the events emitted by the transaction should be included in the response.
  - `logIndices` is an array of integers that specifies the indices of the logs we want to include in the response.
    If empty, all logs are included.
    For performance reasons, the FDC allows at most 50 logs to be included in the response.

Full specification of the EVMTransaction attestation type can be found at the [EVMTransaction type definition](https://github.com/flare-foundation/songbird-state-connector-protocol/blob/main/specs/attestations/active-types/EVMTransaction.md)

A simple script to prepare the request is shown below:

```typescript title="prepareRequest.ts"
// Simple hex encoding
function toHex(data) {
  var result = "";
  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    result += data.charCodeAt(i).toString(16);
  }
  return result.padEnd(64, "0");
}

const BASE_URL = "https://fdc-verifiers-testnet.flare.network/";
const API_KEY = "XXX"; // Your API key

const TX_ID =
  "0x4e636c6590b22d8dcdade7ee3b5ae5572f42edb1878f09b3034b2f7c3362ef3c";

async function prepareRequest() {
  const attestationType = "0x" + toHex("EVMTransaction");
  const sourceType = "0x" + toHex("testETH");
  const requestData = {
    attestationType: attestationType,
    sourceId: sourceType,
    requestBody: {
      transactionHash: TX_ID,
      requiredConfirmations: "1",
      provideInput: true,
      listEvents: true,
      logIndices: [],
    },
  };
  const response = await fetch(
    `${BASE_URL}verifier/eth/EVMTransaction/prepareRequest`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "X-API-KEY": API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(requestData),
    },
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log("Prepared request:", data);
  return data;
}

prepareRequest().then((data) => {
  console.log("Prepared request:", data);
  process.exit(0);
});
```

The verifier successfully prepares the request and returns the following JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "VALID",
  "abiEncodedRequest": "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"
}
```

The `status` field indicates that the verifier recognized this attestation request as valid.
The `abiEncodedRequest` contains all the data necessary for the FDC attestation providers to confirm this request.

This encoded request is what you'll submit to the Data Connector contract.
Once submitted, it will be emitted as an event, picked up by attestation clients, and included in the next round of FDC consensus.
If the consensus is reached, this specific attestation will be included in the Merkle root for that round and you will be able to use it.
If there is no consensus, the data will not be included in the Merkle root and there will be no proof available for it - in that case, you will need to resubmit the request.

<details>
    <summary>Understanding the structure of `abiEncodedRequest`.</summary>

    The structure of `abiEncodedRequest` may seem complex, but it's essentially a concatenated hex string (with the initial 0x removed) representing different parts of the request. Each part is 32 bytes long (64 characters in hex). Here's a breakdown of the string:

    ```text
    45564d5472616e73616374696f6e000000000000000000000000000000000000
    7465737445544800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    9d410778cc0b2b8f1b8eaa79cbd0eed5d3be7514dea070e2041ad00a4c6e88f8
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020
    4e636c6590b22d8dcdade7ee3b5ae5572f42edb1878f09b3034b2f7c3362ef3c
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a0
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    ```

    You can decode the first two parts using an online tool like [playcode.io](https://playcode.io/1752890).

    Breaking it down line-by-line:

    - **First line:** `toHex("EVMTransaction")`

    - **Second line:** `toHex("testETH")`

    - **Third line:** Message Integrity Code (MIC). This is a hash of the whole response salted with a string `Flare`. It ensures the integrity of the attestation and prevents tampering.

    - **Remaining lines:** ABI encoded request body (as solidity struct).
      The structure of the body is defined in the accompanying attestation [type specification](https://github.com/flare-foundation/songbird-state-connector-protocol/blob/main/contracts/interface/types/EVMTransaction.sol#L68).
      As we supply a list, the encoding is a bit more complicated, but you can easily spot the `transactionHash` as `4e636c6590b22d8dcdade7ee3b5ae5572f42edb1878f09b3034b2f7c3362ef3c`.

</details>

### 3. Submitting the attestation request

The next step is to request attestation on the Flare Data Connector smart contract, thus broadcasting to the entire network that you want this transaction to be proven.

Once the attestation is requested you can calculate the `roundId` - The Data Connector round that was in the collect phase the moment the attestation was requested.
When the round is finalized (this usually takes between 90-180 seconds), you will be able to extract the Merkle proof and use it to verify the attestation.
To submit the attestation request, we will use the `requestAttestation` function on the `FDCHub` contract and get the `roundId` from the transaction receipt.
We are now interacting with the blockchain directly - so we will need the ABI of the FDC and it's address.
The provided script uses hardcoded ABI and address for the Coston testnet for simplicity, but anything more than a simple test should use get the address from `ContractRegistry` and the ABI from Flare' official abi library to ensure compatibility with the latest version of the contract.

:::note

You can get the proof before the round is finalized, but it will not be valid until the round is finalized and the Merkle root is stored on the chain.

:::

```typescript title="submitRequest.ts"
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

// In production get the data directly from FlareSystemsManager
const firstVotingRoundStartTs = 1658429955;
const votingEpochDurationSeconds = 90;

const FDC_HUB_ADDRESS = "0x1c78A073E3BD2aCa4cc327d55FB0cD4f0549B55b"; // Valid only on coston. In production get the address from the ContractRegistry

async function submitRequest() {
  const requestData = await prepareRequest();

  const fdcHUB = await ethers.getContractAt(
    [
      {
        inputs: [
          {
            internalType: "bytes",
            name: "_data",
            type: "bytes",
          },
        ],
        name: "requestAttestation",
        outputs: [],
        stateMutability: "payable",
        type: "function",
      },
    ],
    "0x1c78A073E3BD2aCa4cc327d55FB0cD4f0549B55b",
  );

  // Call to the FDC Hub protocol to provide attestation.
  const tx = await fdcHUB.requestAttestation(requestData.abiEncodedRequest, {
    value: ethers.parseEther("1"),
  });
  const receipt = await tx.wait();

  // Get block number of the block containing contract call
  const blockNumber = receipt.blockNumber;
  const block = await ethers.provider.getBlock(blockNumber);

  // Calculate roundId
  const roundId = Math.floor(
    (block!.timestamp - firstVotingRoundStartTs) / votingEpochDurationSeconds,
  );
  console.log(
    `Check round progress at: https://coston-systems-explorer.flare.rocks/voting-epoch/${roundId}?tab=fdc`,
  );
  return roundId;
}
```

We now need to wait for the round to be finalized and the Merkle root to be stored on the chain.

### 4. Extracting the Merkle proof and full data

Once the the FDC round is finalized the Merkle root becomes available on the chain.
For each of the requests that were included in the round, full data with accompanying Merkle proof can be generated.
This proof attests that the hash of our requested date indeed resides within the accepted Merkle tree, thereby confirming its acceptance by both the group of attestors and the Data Connector smart contract.
The easiest way to do it is to use the DA Layer API.

The DA Layer API provides a simple endpoint to get the proof for a specific request for both FDC, FTSO and other services on Flare Network.
The publicly available endpoint is `NOT YET AVAILABLE` and is rate limited, but you can set up your own DA Layer service using the provided [DA Layer deployment](https://github.com/flare-foundation/data-availability).

To get the proof and data, we query the `/api/v0/fdc/get-proof-round-id-bytes` on the DA Layer API.
The request body is a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "roundId": FDC_ROUND_ID,
  "requestBytes": "0xABI_ENCODED_REQUEST"
}
```

We are providing the same `abiEncodedRequest` that we used to request the attestation, and the `roundId` that we calculated when we submitted the request.

```typescript title="getProof.ts"
const DA_LAYER_URL = "DA_LAYER_URL";
const TARGET_ROUND_ID = 123; // The round id we want to get the proof for (the one we calculated when we submitted the request)

async function getProof(roundId: number) {
  const request = await prepareRequest();
  const proofAndData = await fetch(
    `${DA_LAYER_URL}api/v0/fdc/get-proof-round-id-bytes`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-API-KEY": API_KEY,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        votingRoundId: roundId,
        requestBytes: request.abiEncodedRequest,
      }),
    },
  );
  return await proofAndData.json();
}

getProof(TARGET_ROUND_ID)
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Proof and data:");
    console.log(JSON.stringify(data, undefined, 2));
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e);
  });
```

The returned JSON will contain the full data about the transaction together with the Merkle proof and look like this:

```json title="Full proof response.json"
{
  "response": {
    "attestationType": "0x45564d5472616e73616374696f6e000000000000000000000000000000000000",

The object contains two top-level fields:

- `response` contains the full data about the transaction, including the attestation type, source chain, and transaction data.
  If you look closely, it is exactly the struct defined in the solidity interface for `EVMTransaction` attestation type (contains request, response and corresponding bodies).
- `proof` contains the Merkle proof asserting that the data is included in the Merkle root for the round.

The top level fields nicely correspond to two things you need to do in the smart contract:

- Verify that the provided transaction data is included in the Merkle root using the Merkle proof.
- Use the `response` data in the contract logic.

We are now ready to use the data in the smart contract.

### 5. Using the data in the smart contract

Let's first take a detailed look at the data we received from the DA Layer API in the `response` field and the corresponding solidity struct.
The interface is already included in both hardhat and foundry packages.

```

The field `requestBody` contains exactly the data we provided when requesting the attestation.
There is some additional metadata like `votingRound` and `lowestUsedTimestamp` that is used during the verification process (to ensure the data is used in the correct round and that it is not outdated).

The most important thing for our purposes is the `responseBody` field.
It contains the information about the requested transaction - block number, timestamp, source address, receiving address, value, input data, status, and the most important part - list of events emitted by the transaction.
Each event contains the log index, emitter address, topics, data, and a flag indicating if the event was removed due to chain reorganization.

Our contract will be very simple and will only be listening to the `Transfer` event emitted by the `USDC` contract `0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238` and store the results.
This means we will go through all the events and only count the ones that match the `Transfer` event from the `USDC` contract.

:::warning

Don't forget to set the EVM version to `london` in Remix before compiling the contract.

:::

We first import the necessary interfaces and `ContractRegistry` library to get the current version of the verifiers (in the background, the registry library uses the `ContractRegistry` maintained by flare governance to route the request to the correct verifier).
The function `isEVMTransactionProofValid` is used to verify the Merkle proof and the data - this is the first step.
Checking the validity of the proof is very simple - the contract registry library is used to get the verifier for EVMTransaction type and then the whole proof is passed to the verifier.
Verifiers returns `true` if the proof is valid and `false` otherwise - the check can then be done by a simple `require` statement.

The main contract logic is in the `collectTransferEvents` function.
The function accepts the whole proof and firstly checks that the proof is valid.
The rest of the function is the business logic.
This is where each use case will be different - in this case, we are only interested in the `Transfer` events from the `USDC` contract.
We simply loop through all the events, filter out ones that are `Transfer` events from the `USDC` contract, decode the data and store the results in the `transferEvents` mapping.

That is all - the contract is ready to be deployed and used to listen to the `Transfer` events from the `USDC` contract.
Keep in mind the two-step process of using the FDC proof - one verifies the proof and the data and the second one is the business logic that uses the data.
This is very important - we sourced the the data from DA Layer API offchain, where the data provider can be malicious and could have provided us with invalid data.
But if the provided data was not exactly the same as the one included in the Merkle root, there is no way that the malicious data provider could have provided us with valid proof.
And the verification part of the contract would have failed - preventing us from using the malicious data.

The offchain part of verification is a very simple process - we just get the proof in the same way as before and feed it to the contract.

### 6. Bonus - Waiting for the round to be finalized (optional)

Due to the inner workings of FDC, you need to wait for the round to be finalized before you can use the proof.
There are multiple ways to do this (depending on your infrastructure and requirements).
All of them depend on making sure the `Relay` contract has accepted the Merkle root for the FDC protocol.
The easiest way to get the `Relay` contract is to use the `ContractRegistry`, to always be sure you are using the latest version of the contract.

Then, you need to wait for the finalization of the round you submitted the request.
This means firstly waiting for the current round to end and then waiting for the `Relay` contract to accept the Merkle root for the FDC protocol.
The most sure way is to listen to the events emitted by the `Relay` contract.
You should be waiting for the `ProtocolMessageRelayed` event with the `protocolId` set to `200` (FDC protocol id) and the `roundId` set to the round you submitted the request.
This is the most sure way to do it in production if you have access to the RPC node where you can easily listen to events.

For testing and development, you can cheat a bit.
The `Relay` contract has a public view method `isFinalized(uint256 _protocolId, uint256 _votingRoundId) returns (bool)` where you can check if the round is finalized.
Just be sure to use the correct round id and if using the public rpc node, make sure to not spam the check too much, as you will get rate limited.
