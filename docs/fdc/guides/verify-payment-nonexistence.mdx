## Reference Payment Nonexistence

[Full specification on GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/songbird-state-connector-protocol/blob/main/specs/attestations/active-types/ReferencedPaymentNonexistence.md).

You are getting more and more familiar with the attestation types, and you are starting to see that they are very powerful and can be used in many different ways. Let's check a more involved one—the `ReferencePaymentNonexistence` type.

This type is a bit more difficult to implement and properly use, as it requires the attestation client to do a lot of work—they need to prove that a certain payment has not been made. Instead of looking at the transaction and checking if it is valid, you will be looking at the block range and checking that no valid payment conforming to your requirements has been made in the specified block range.

/**
 * @custom:name ReferencedPaymentNonexistence
 * @custom:id 0x04
 * @custom:supported BTC, DOGE, XRP, testBTC, testDOGE, testXRP
 * @author Flare
 * @notice Assertion that an agreed-upon payment has not been made by a certain deadline.
 * A confirmed request shows that a transaction meeting certain criteria (address, amount, reference) did not appear in the specified block range.
 *
 *
 * This type of attestation can be used to e.g. provide grounds to liquidate funds locked by a smart contract on Flare when a payment is missed.
 *
 * @custom:verification If `firstOverflowBlock` cannot be determined or does not have a sufficient [number of confirmations](/specs/attestations/configs.md#finalityconfirmation), the attestation request is rejected.
 * If `firstOverflowBlockNumber` is higher or equal to `minimalBlockNumber`, the request is rejected.
 * The search range are blocks between heights including `minimalBlockNumber` and excluding `firstOverflowBlockNumber`.
 * If the verifier does not have a view of all blocks from `minimalBlockNumber` to `firstOverflowBlockNumber`, the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * The request is confirmed if no transaction meeting the specified criteria is found in the search range.
 * The criteria and timestamp are chain specific.
 * ### UTXO (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)
 *
 *
 * Criteria for the transaction:
 *
 *
 * - It is not coinbase transaction.
 * - The transaction has the specified [standardPaymentReference](/specs/attestations/external-chains/standardPaymentReference.md#btc-and-doge-blockchains).
 * - The sum of values of all outputs with the specified address minus the sum of values of all inputs with the specified address is greater than `amount` (in practice the sum of all values of the inputs with the specified address is zero).
 *
 *
 * Timestamp is `mediantime`.

 * ### XRPL
 *
 *
 *
 * Criteria for the transaction:
 * - The transaction is of type payment.
 * - The transaction has the specified [standardPaymentReference](/specs/attestations/external-chains/standardPaymentReference.md#xrp),
 * - One of the following is true:
 *   - Transaction status is `SUCCESS` and the amount received by the specified destination address is greater than the specified `value`.
 *   - Transaction status is `RECEIVER_FAILURE` and the specified destination address would receive an amount greater than the specified `value` had the transaction been successful.
 *
 *
 * Timestamp is `close_time` converted to UNIX time.

#### Request Body

The request body for the `ReferencePaymentNonexistence` attestation type is a bit larger, as you need to specify the range of blocks to check and the criteria for the payment to check.

- **`minimalBlockNumber`**: The start block of the search range.

- **`deadlineBlockNumber`**: The block number to be included in the search range.

- **`deadlineTimestamp`**: The timestamp to be included in the search range. By including both block number and timestamp, the requested range will encompass all blocks from `minimalBlockNumber` to `deadlineBlockNumber` and all blocks with timestamps from `minimalBlockTimestamp` to `deadlineTimestamp`.

- **`destinationAddressHash`**: The standard address hash of the address to which the payment should have been made.

- **`amount`**: The requested amount in minimal units that should have been paid. The amount is chain specific.

- **`standardPaymentReference`**: The requested standard payment reference that the payment should have had.

#### Response Body

The response body is simpler and essentially contains the searched range:

- **`minimalBlockTimestamp`**: The timestamp of the minimal block that was included in the search range—this is the timestamp of the block with `minimalBlockNumber`.

- **`firstOverflowBlockNumber`**: The height of the first overflow block. This is the first block with a block number higher than `deadlineBlockNumber` and a timestamp later than `deadlineTimestamp`.

- **`firstOverflowBlockTimestamp`**: The timestamp of the first overflow block. This is the timestamp of the first block with a block number higher than `deadlineBlockNumber` and a timestamp later than `deadlineTimestamp`.

#### Confirmation

If the request is confirmed, it means that there was no payment in the specified range (including the minimal block, but excluding the maximal block) with an amount greater than or equal to the requested amount and with the requested reference.

The full rules for verification are quite complex (and chain-dependent) and are available in the [specification](https://github.com/flare-foundation/songbird-state-connector-protocol/blob/main/specs/attestations/active-types/ReferencedPaymentNonexistence.md#verification). The important point is that the request is confirmed if no transaction meeting the specified criteria is found in the search range.

### Example

To produce a correct and thorough example that allows you to test everything properly, you need to be careful. Since you are proving a negative, any mistake during request preparation can result in a transaction that was not made (a simple mis-encoding of a memo field would almost certainly produce a non-existing transaction) and give a false sense of security.

To ensure accuracy, structure your request as follows:

1. **Create a transaction** with a reference payment and some nonzero value.
2. **Confirm `Payment` attestation request** to make sure you get back the correct reference and value, ensuring the transaction is seen. Use the information about when this transaction happened to construct a range for the next step, ensuring it contains your transaction.
3. **Make three requests for non-existing payments**:
   - **Correct (or lower) value and correct reference**: This should return `INVALID`, as the verifier can't prove the non-existence of such a transaction.
   - **Correct value but slightly wrong payment reference**: Change just one index of the reference. This should be confirmed, as no such transaction exists (the payment reference does not match).
   - **Too large value but correct payment reference**: This should be confirmed, as the transaction with the payment reference exists but does not transfer enough value.

#### XRP Ledger

The example code that showcases this on testnet XRP Ledger is available in `tryXRPLPaymentNonExistence.ts`.

}

Keep in mind, that the requested range can be quite large, so the verifiers might not be able to confirm the response (as they might not have the view of all blocks from `minimalBlockNumber` to `firstOverflowBlockNumber`), so the request might be rejected.
