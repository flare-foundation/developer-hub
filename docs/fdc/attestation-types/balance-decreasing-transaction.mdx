Information describing a transaction that either **decreases the balance** for a specified address.

A transaction is considered “balance decreasing” for the specified address if:

1. The balance **after the transaction** is lower than **before**.
2. The address is among the **signers** of the transaction (even if its balance is not reduced).

## Supported chains

- `BTC` (Bitcoin)
- `DOGE` (Dogecoin)
- `XRP` (XRP Ledger)
- Test networks: `testBTC` (Bitcoin Testnet v3), `testDOGE`, `testXRP`

## Response

| Field                      | Solidity Type | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blockNumber`              | `uint64`      | Block number containing the transaction.                               |
| `blockTimestamp`           | `uint64`      | Timestamp of the block containing the transaction.                     |

| `standardPaymentReference` | `bytes32`     | Standardized payment reference of the transaction, if available.       |

:::warning[Standard Payment Reference]

If a transaction has no `standardPaymentReference`, it is set to default value, thus, zero value reference should be used with caution.

## Verification process

1. The transaction identified by `transactionId` is fetched from the **source blockchain node** or a relevant indexer.
2. If the transaction cannot be fetched or is in a block with insufficient [confirmations](#finality), the attestation request is rejected.
3. Once the transaction is retrieved, the response fields are extracted if it qualifies as **balance decreasing** for the specified address.

The verification process is chain-specific and can be computed with a [balance decreasing summary](#balance-decreasing-summary), with details described below.

### UTXO chains (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)

- `sourceAddressIndicator`: Represents the index of the transaction input, formatted as a **0x-prefixed 32-byte string**.
  - If the specified input does not exist or lacks an associated address, the attestation request is rejected.
- `sourceAddress`: Address associated with the specified transaction input.
- `spentAmount`: Calculated as `Sum of all inputs with sourceAddress - Sum of all outputs with sourceAddress`. The value can be negative.
- `blockTimestamp`: The **mediantime** of the block.

### Account-based chains (XRPL)

- `sourceAddressIndicator`: The [standard address hash](#standard-address-hash) of the address in question.
  - If the indicated address is not among the transaction signers and its balance was not decreased, the attestation request is rejected.
- `spentAmount`: Difference between the balance of the address **after** and **before** the transaction. Can be negative.
- `blockTimestamp`: The **close_time** of the ledger, converted to Unix time.

:::note[Lowest used timestamp]

For the `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter, the `blockTimestamp` of the transaction is used.

## Balance decreasing summary

A balance-decreasing summary analyses a transaction that has decreased or could possibly decrease the balance of an account.

A balance-decreasing summary is calculated for a given transaction and source address indicator (`sourceAddressIndicator`).
The summary contains the fields as stated in the table below.
The interpretation of some fields is chain dependent.
Descriptions of these fields are left empty and are later explained for each specific blockchain.

For a given transaction and an address indicator, the balance-decreasing summary can only be calculate if the transaction is considered to be balance-decreasing for the indicated address
When implemented, the function that calculates the balance-decreasing summary
tries to calculate it.
If it is successful, it returns a success status and the summary itself.
If not, it returns an error status.

| Field                      | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId`            | -                                                          |
| `transactionStatus`        | [Transaction success status](#transaction-success-status). |
| `sourceAddress`            | -                                                          |
| `spentAmount`              | -                                                          |
| `standardPaymentReference` | [Standard payment reference](#standard-payment-reference). |

The following are detailed descriptions of fields for each supported chain.

### Bitcoin and Dogecoin

For Bitcoin and Dogecoin, `sourceAddressIndicator` is the index of a transaction input (in hex zero padded on the left to 0x prefixed 32 bytes).
If the input with the given index does not exist or the indicated input does not have an address, no summary is made.
In particular, no summary is made for coinbase transactions.

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId` | The transaction ID found in the field `txid`. For segwit transactions, this is not the same as _hash_.                             |
| `sourceAddress` | Address of the indicated input.                                                                                                    |
| `spentAmount`   | The sum of values of all inputs with `sourceAddress` minus the sum of values of all outputs with `sourceAddress`. Can be negative. |

### XRPL

For XRPL, `sourceAddressIndicator` is [standardAddressHash](#standard-address-hash) of the indicated address.
If the `sourceAddressIndicator` does not match any of the addresses who signed the transaction or whose balance was decreased by the transaction, the summary is not made.

| Field           |                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId` | Hash of the transaction found in the field `hash`.                                                |
| `sourceAddress` | Address whose [standardAddressHash](#standard-address-hash) matches the `sourceAddressIndicator`. |
| `spentAmount`   | The amount for which the balance of the `sourceAddress` has lowered. Can be negative.             |
