import StandardPaymentReference from "./_standard_payment_reference.mdx";
import Finality from "./_finality.mdx";

Assertion that a specific payment, agreed upon to be completed by a certain deadline, has **not been made**. If confirmed, it shows that no transaction meeting the specified criteria (address, amount, reference) was found within the given block range.

This Information can be used, for example, to justify the liquidation of funds locked in a smart contract on Songbird if a payment is missed.

| `minimalBlockNumber`       | `uint64`      | The block number to start the search range.                                   |
| `deadlineBlockNumber`      | `uint64`      | The block number to include as the end of the search range.                   |

:::note

**Standard Addresses Root** is the root of the Merkle tree build on double keccak256 hashes of the all source addresses of the transaction.

## Response

| Field                         | Solidity Type | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `minimalBlockTimestamp`       | `uint64`      | The timestamp of the block at `minimalBlockNumber`.           |
| `firstOverflowBlockNumber`    | `uint64`      | The block number immediately after the `deadlineBlockNumber`. |
| `firstOverflowBlockTimestamp` | `uint64`      | The timestamp of the `firstOverflowBlockNumber`.              |

- **`firstOverflowBlockNumber`**: This is the first block with a height greater than `deadlineBlockNumber` and a timestamp later than `deadlineTimestamp`.
- The search range includes blocks from `minimalBlockNumber` (inclusive) to `firstOverflowBlockNumber` (exclusive).

## Verification process

1. **Block Confirmation**:

   - If the `firstOverflowBlock` cannot be determined or lacks the required [number of confirmations](#finality), the request is rejected.
   - The request is also rejected if `firstOverflowBlockNumber` is less than or equal to `minimalBlockNumber`.

2. **Search Range**:

   - The search range includes blocks from `minimalBlockNumber` to `firstOverflowBlockNumber` (exclusive).
   - If the verifier does not have complete visibility of all blocks in this range, the request is rejected.

3. **Transaction Validation**:
   - The request is confirmed if **no transaction** meeting the specified criteria (address, source addresses root, amount, reference) is found within the specified block range.
   - The criteria and timestamp interpretation are specific to each chain.

The verification process is chain-specific, with details described below.

### UTXO chains (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)

#### Transaction Criteria

- The transaction **must not be a coinbase transaction**.
- The transaction must include the specified [standard payment reference](#standard-payment-reference).
- If `checkSourceAddresses` is set to true, the `sourceAddressesRoot` of the transaction must match the specified `sourceAddressesRoot`.
- The sum of all output values sent to the specified address **minus** the sum of all input values from the same address must be **greater than the specified `amount`**.
  - Typically, the sum of input values for the specified address is zero.

#### Timestamp

- Uses the **mediantime** of the block.

### Account-based chains (XRPL)

#### Transaction Criteria

- The transaction must be of type **Payment**.
- The transaction must include the specified [standard payment reference](#standard-payment-reference).
- If `checkSourceAddresses` is set to true, the `sourceAddressesRoot` of the transaction must match the specified `sourceAddressesRoot`.
- One of the following conditions must hold:
  - The transaction status is `SUCCESS` and the amount received by the specified address is greater than the specified `amount`.
  - The transaction status is `RECEIVER_FAILURE` and the specified address would have received an amount greater than the specified `amount` if the transaction had succeeded.

#### Timestamp

- Uses the **close_time** of the ledger, converted to UNIX time.

:::note[Lowest used timestamp]

For the `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter, the value of `minimalBlockTimestamp` is used.
