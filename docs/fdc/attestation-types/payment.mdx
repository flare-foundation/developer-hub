Information about a transaction on an external chain that is classified as a **native currency payment**.
Each supported blockchain specifies how a payment transaction should be formatted to be provable using this attestation type. These provable payments mimic traditional banking transactions where entity A sends a native currency to entity B, with an optional payment reference.

:::warning[Standard Payment Reference]

If a transaction has no `standardPaymentReference`, it is set to default value, thus, zero value reference should be used with caution.

:::

## Verification Process

1. The transaction identified by `transactionId` is fetched from the relevant blockchain node or indexer.
2. If the transaction cannot be retrieved or is in a block with insufficient [confirmations](#finality), the attestation request is rejected.
3. Once the transaction data is fetched, a [payment summary](#payment-summary) is computed according to the chain-specific rules.
   - If the payment summary is successfully generated, the response is populated using this data.
   - If the summary cannot be computed, the attestation request is rejected.
4. The fields `blockNumber` and `blockTimestamp` are extracted from the block data if they are not directly available in the transaction data.
   - For **Bitcoin** and **Dogecoin**, the `blockTimestamp` is derived from the **mediantime** of the block.
   - For **XRPL**, the `blockTimestamp` is derived from the **close time** of the ledger, converted to UNIX time.

:::note[Lowest used timestamp]

For the `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter, the **`blockTimestamp`** of the transaction is used.

:::

## Payment Summary

A **payment summary** consolidates all relevant data about a transaction that represents a payment. This is particularly focused on payments between one source account (address) and one target account.

- **UTXO Blockchains (e.g., BTC, DOGE)**: Payments can aggregate inputs from multiple addresses and distribute them to multiple outputs. The summary here is computed based on specified input and output indices that identify addresses of interest.
- **XRPL**: Supports various transaction types, but a payment summary is only fully calculated for transactions of type `Payment`.

### Structure

The summary includes the fields detailed in the table below.
The interpretation of certain fields may vary based on the blockchain.
Chain-specific explanations are provided in the sections that follow.

| Field                      | Description                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId`            | The unique identifier of the transaction.                                             |
| `transactionStatus`        | The [success status](#transaction-success-status) of the transaction.                 |
| `standardPaymentReference` | A reference defined in the [standard payment reference](#standard-payment-reference). |
| `oneToOne`                 | Indicates if the transaction involves a single sender and a single receiver.          |
| `sourceAddress`            | The originating address involved in the transaction.                                  |
| `sourceAddressesRoot`      | The root of the Merkle tree of the source addresses.                                  |
| `spentAmount`              | The total amount spent by the source address.                                         |
| `intendedSourceAmount`     | The expected amount intended to be sent from the source address.                      |
| `receivingAddress`         | The target address receiving the payment.                                             |
| `intendedReceivingAddress` | The expected target address intended to receive the payment.                          |
| `receivedAmount`           | The actual amount received by the receiving address.                                  |
| `intendedReceivingAmount`  | The expected amount intended to be received.                                          |

:::note

- **Standard Address Hashes**: [Standard address hashes](#standard-address-hash) can be derived from addresses.
- If `transactionStatus` is not `SUCCESS`, the `receivingAddress` is set to an empty string, and its hash defaults to a zeroed 32-byte string.
- **Standard Addresses Root** is the root of the Merkle tree build on double keccak256 hashes of the all source addresses of the transaction.

### UTXO chains (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)

The payment summary for Bitcoin and Dogecoin is derived using specified indices for a transaction input and output.

#### Conditions

- If the specified input or output does not exist, or lacks an address (e.g., outputs using `OP_RETURN`), no summary is generated.
- Coinbase transactions are not summarized.

#### Data Sources

- For Bitcoin, all transaction details are retrieved using the `getrawtransaction` endpoint (verbosity 2) and `getblock`. This requires a Bitcoin node version â‰¥ 25.0.
- For Dogecoin, since `getrawtransaction` with verbosity 2 is not supported, alternative methods must be used to access input transaction data.

| Field                      | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionId`            | The transaction ID (`txid`). For SegWit transactions, this differs from `hash`.                                                                 |
| `oneToOne`                 | `true` if only `sourceAddress` is present in inputs, and outputs include only `receivingAddress`, `sourceAddress` (for change), or `OP_RETURN`. |
| `sourceAddress`            | Address of the specified input.                                                                                                                 |
| `spentAmount`              | Total value of all inputs with `sourceAddress` minus total value of all outputs to `sourceAddress`.                                             |
| `intendedSourceAmount`     | Same as `spentAmount`.                                                                                                                          |
| `receivingAddress`         | Address of the specified output.                                                                                                                |
| `intendedReceivingAddress` | Always matches `receivingAddress`.                                                                                                              |
| `receivedAmount`           | Total value of outputs to `receivingAddress` minus total value of inputs from `receivingAddress`.                                               |
| `intendedReceivingAmount`  | Same as `receivedAmount`.                                                                                                                       |

### Account-based chains (XRPL)

The payment summary on XRPL is applicable only for transactions of type `Payment`.

#### Conditions

- Only `Payment` transactions are summarized; other transaction types are ignored.
- A successful payment has exactly one sender and at most one receiver. If unsuccessful, no receiver is recorded.

#### Data Sources

- Transaction details are obtained via the [`tx`](https://xrpl.org/tx.html) method.
- Changes made by the transaction are recorded in the `meta` field (or `metaData` if fetched via the `ledger` method) under `AffectedNodes`. Balance changes are found within `ModifiedNodes`, by comparing `FinalFields` and `PreviousFields`.

| Field                      | Description                                                                                                                                |

| `oneToOne`                 | Always `true`, as each `Payment` transaction has exactly one sender and at most one receiver.                                              |
| `sourceAddress`            | Address that sent the payment, reducing its balance.                                                                                       |
| `spentAmount`              | Amount by which `sourceAddress`'s balance was reduced.                                                                                     |
| `intendedSourceAmount`     | Calculated as `Amount + Fee`. If `transactionStatus` is `SUCCESS`, it matches `spentAmount`.                                               |

| `intendedReceivingAddress` | Address specified in the `Destination` field.                                                                                              |
| `receivedAmount`           | Amount by which the `receivingAddress`'s balance was increased. Can be zero if the transaction failed.                                     |
| `intendedReceivingAmount`  | Expected increase in `intendedReceivingAddress`'s balance if successful. Found in the `Amount` field. Matches `spentAmount` if successful. |
