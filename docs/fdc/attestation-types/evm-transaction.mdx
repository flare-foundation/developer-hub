## Request

| Field                   | Solidity Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transactionHash`       | `bytes32`     | The hash of the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `requiredConfirmations` | `uint16`      | The number of confirmations required for the block containing the transaction to be considered final by the requestor.                                                                                                                                          |
| `provideInput`          | `bool`        | If set to `true`, the `input` data field of the transaction will be included in the response.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `listEvents`            | `bool`        | If `true`, events specified by `logIndices` will be included in the response. If `false`, no events are included.                                                                                                                                               |
| `logIndices`            | `uint32[]`    | A list of event indices (`logIndex`) to be relayed if `listEvents` is `true`. Should be sorted by the requestor. Maximum of 50 indices allowed. An empty list indicates all events up to a maximum of 50. If `listEvents` is `false`, this field must be empty. |

:::note[Using Event Logs Correctly]

- Events (logs) are indexed at the **block level**, not at the transaction level.
- The contract using this attestation should define the order of event logs, and the requestor should ensure `logIndices` are sorted according to these specifications.

## Response

The response fields align with EVM's [JSON-RPC API](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactionbyhash):

| Field              | Solidity Type | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blockNumber`      | `uint64`      | The block number in which the transaction is included.                                                |
| `timestamp`        | `uint64`      | The timestamp of the block in which the transaction is included.                                      |
| `sourceAddress`    | `address`     | The address (`from`) that signed the transaction.                                                     |
| `isDeployment`     | `bool`        | Indicates whether the transaction is a contract creation (`true`) or a regular transaction (`false`). |
| `receivingAddress` | `address`     | The address (`to`) receiving the transaction. Zero address if `isDeployment` is `true`.               |
| `value`            | `uint256`     | The value transferred in the transaction, in wei.                                                     |
| `input`            | `bytes`       | Transaction input data if `provideInput` is `true`; otherwise, returns `0x00`.                        |
| `status`           | `uint8`       | Transaction status: `1` for success, `0` for failure.                                                 |
| `events`           | `Event[]`     | An array of requested events if `listEvents` is `true`; otherwise, an empty array.                    |

### `Event` Struct

Each `Event` struct represents a log entry similar to EVM event logs:

| Field            | Solidity Type | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `logIndex`       | `uint32`      | The index of the event within the block.                                                   |
| `emitterAddress` | `address`     | The address of the contract that emitted the event.                                        |
| `topics`         | `bytes32[]`   | An array of up to four 32-byte strings representing indexed log arguments.                 |
| `data`           | `bytes`       | Non-indexed log data, concatenated as 32-byte strings. Must be at least 32 bytes long.     |
| `removed`        | `bool`        | `true` if the log was removed due to a chain reorganization; `false` if it is still valid. |

## Verification process

1. The function checks if the transaction with the given `transactionHash` is included in a block on the **main chain** with at least the specified `requiredConfirmations`.
2. If the block has insufficient confirmations or if the transaction is not found, the request is rejected.
3. If `listEvents` is enabled and an event specified by `logIndices` does not exist, the request is also rejected.
4. The specified data (transaction details, input data, and events) is retrieved and relayed based on the request parameters.

:::note[Event handling]

- Ensure `logIndices` are sorted as required by the consuming contract.
- If `logIndices` is not empty while `listEvents` is set to `false`, the request will be rejected.
- Events are capped at a maximum of **50 entries** to optimize performance.
