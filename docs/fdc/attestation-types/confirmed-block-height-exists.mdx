Assertion whether a block with the specified `blockNumber` is **confirmed** with additional data to compute the **block production rate** within a given time window.

## Supported chains

- `BTC` (Bitcoin)
- `DOGE` (Dogecoin)
- `XRP` (XRP Ledger)
- Test networks: `testBTC` (Bitcoin Testnet v3), `testDOGE`, `testXRP`

## Request

| Field         | Solidity Type | Description                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blockNumber` | `uint64`      | The block number to confirm.                                         |
| `queryWindow` | `uint64`      | The time period (in seconds) to calculate the block production rate. |

## Response

| Field                             | Solidity Type | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blockTimestamp`                  | `uint64`      | The timestamp of the block at `blockNumber`.                                                             |
| `numberOfConfirmations`           | `uint64`      | The required number of confirmations for the block to be considered confirmed (chain-specific).          |
| `lowestQueryWindowBlockNumber`    | `uint64`      | The block number of the latest block with a timestamp strictly less than `blockTimestamp - queryWindow`. |
| `lowestQueryWindowBlockTimestamp` | `uint64`      | The timestamp of the block at `lowestQueryWindowBlockNumber`.                                            |

## Verification process

1. The function checks if the block with `blockNumber` is confirmed by at least the required `numberOfConfirmations` for the specified chain.
   - If the block does not meet this requirement, the request is rejected.
   - A block at the tip of the chain has exactly **1 confirmation**.
2. The lowestQueryWindowBlock` is identified, and its block number and timestamp are extracted.
3. The required confirmations are defined based on chain-specific [finality](#finality).
4. The returned `timestamp` is:
   - `mediantime` for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
   - `close_time` for XRPL.

:::note[Lowest used timestamp]

For the `lowestUsedTimestamp` parameter, the value of `lowestQueryWindowBlockTimestamp` is used.
